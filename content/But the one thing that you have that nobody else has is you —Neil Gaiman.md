"The urge, starting out, is to copy. And that's not a bad thing. Most of us only find our own voices after we've sounded like a lot of other people. But the one thing that you have that nobody else has is you. Your voice, your mind, your story, your vision. So write and draw and build and play and dance and live as only you can." â€”Neil Gaiman, via [The Powerful Reason You Should Tell Your Story](https://thewritepractice.com/tell-your-story/)
