# What we think is good is rather just familiar enough
Douglas Hofstadter says our comparison of new things to the familiar is the "fuel and fire of thinking." We understand new things better when they're made to resemble old things.[^1]

We all imitate the familiar in our creating. [[Imitation is an exercise in finding one's voice]].
