# When you don't have a gig, hire yourself as practice
If you have off-time between jobs, you can always practice. Assign yourself the kind of job you'd like to get hired to do, and then [[Make what you like]].[^1] My friend Lawrence does this with his acting. He just loves doing it.

By practicing daily, you will build skills and create more pieces to exhibit in your portfolio, which will help you get more gigs.[^2] As an audio engineer and producer, I can write songs and produce them. Maybe I have fellows who want to collaborate for the pay-off of just having something new for their portfolio too.

[[What kind of songs do I want to write?]] [[What kind of music do I want to produce and engineer?]] [[What kind of music do I want to play?]] [[What kind of lessons do I want to teach?]]
