# Wayne Shorter's and Herbie Hancock's advice to the next generation of artists
These pieces of advice remind me of [[Corita Kent's ten rules for teachers and students]].

First, awaken to your humanity.
Embrace and conquer the road less traveled.
Welcome the unknown.
[[Understand the true nature of obstacles]].
Don't be afraid to interact with those who are different from you.
Strive to create agenda-free dialogue.
Be wary of ego.
Work toward a business without borders.
Appreciate the generation that walked before you.
Lastly, we hope that you live in a state of constant wonder.[^1]
