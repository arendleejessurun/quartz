# Compost that shit
Joe Pug calls the stack of unfinished songs the "bone pile." I like to call it the compost pile. Even trash and shit can become good fertilizer. Sometimes there's still a kernel of something good in there that can sprout into a new plant. And even if that's not so, the practice of making something "bad" still fertilizes the soil for something else to grow.
