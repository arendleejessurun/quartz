# Fear is a part of the creative process
![[The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek]]

Making and sharing art is scary. Fear often triggers us to want to quit, procrastinate, or turn to numbing behaviors.[^1] Steven Pressfield calls this resistance (see [[Recognizing performance anxiety]]).[^2] Maybe that's why so many artists have been addicts: for fear.

Fear can be a positive sign, a sign of risk and potential for growth, an indicator of newness. Whenever Libby Black feels fear about her work, she knows she's onto something good.[^3] Fear can also be an indicator of a desire to grow in your skills.[^4] Instead of talking to yourself negatively, like, "You're not a good enough songwriter," take action by practicing your craft.
