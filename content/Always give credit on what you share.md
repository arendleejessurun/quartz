# Always give credit on what you share
Good attribution includes:
- What the work is
- Who made it
- How they made it
- When and where it was made
- Why you're sharing it
- Why people should care
- Where people can find more
- Where/how you found it[^1]

If you can't find the credit, it may be best not to share.[^2]

[[People appreciate art more when they see behind the scenes]].
