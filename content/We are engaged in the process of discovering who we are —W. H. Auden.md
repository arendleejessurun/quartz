"Between the ages of twenty and forty we are engaged in the process of discovering who we are, which involves learning the difference between accidental limitations which it is our study to outgrow and the necessary limitations of our nature beyond which we cannot trespass with impunity. Few of us can learn this without making mistakes, without trying to become a little more of a universal man than we are permitted to be. It is during this period that a writer can most easily be led astray by another writer or by some ideology." â€”W. H. Auden, [Auden on Writing, Originality, Self-Criticism, and How to Be a Good Reader](https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/08/10/auden-dyers-hand-reading-writing/?utm_source=pocket_mylist)
