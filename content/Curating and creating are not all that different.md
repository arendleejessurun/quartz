# Curating and creating are not all that different
Writer and former bookseller Jonathan Lethem says he's basically a curator, wanting to draw people's attention to things he liked.[^1] But make sure to [[Always give credit on what you share]]. Curating is basically just the first element of creativity: copying. Kirby Ferguson says [[Creativity is just copying, transforming, and combining]].[^2]

To [[Share your work in progress]] may look like sharing your tastes, influences, inspirations, etc. Whatever you collect can be turned into a curation. These things show other people what you're about, sometimes more than your own work.[^1]

Part of the job of an artist is to call attention to overlooked things, to help others [[Observe the little things]].[^3] Again, this reminds me of the story of Michaelsoft Binbows, which I wrote about in [[Attraction, not promotion]].
