# Find your voice in obscurity and solitude
You already have a voice; it's built into you.[^1] Rilke says you must first go into solitude to find it.[^2]

![[That alone is living the artist's life]]

Celebrities, especially young ones, must struggle with inauthenticity when managed by suits and huge markets. One perk of being a small potato is not having to face that pressure. So don't be fooled by any "inner suits" pressuring you to be more relatable. [[Beware of following trends]] because as soon as you cater to one, there's a new one that has supplanted it.[^3]

![[We all have three voices]]

Perhaps solitude is the place to work out the dynamic between these voices.
