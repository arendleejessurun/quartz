# Creativity is a collaboration with God
![[All works of art are commissioned â€”W. H. Auden]]

There is a creativity of [[Letting go|letting]] (something I heard Conrad Potts say), of being in the moment and improvising. Letting go is an antidote to judgment, and [[Judgment is a creativity thief]]. Also, [[Art is conversation]]. [[Collaboration is about the greater good]].

Harlan Howard says, "He writes the songs. I hold the pen."[^1]
