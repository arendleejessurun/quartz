"Some artists focus heavily on mimicking fads or trends, and doing that might sustain an art practice for a period of time. However, if your work gets stuck in a trend that has been dead for a while or your work changes only when trends shift, it will inevitably fall flat." â€”Lisa Congdon, [[Find Your Artistic Voice]] pg. 45
