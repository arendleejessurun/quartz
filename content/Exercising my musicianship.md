# Exercising my musicianship
Yesterday, while climbing just to exercise and work on my technique, not to try anything new, I realized that working on my guitar and singing technique is its own form of exercise.

What if I start treating practice as a part of my exercise regimen? Like a professional athlete trains for their job, I want to do the same.

This ties in to [[Corita Kent's ten rules for teachers and students]] and [[How to make creativity a habit]].
