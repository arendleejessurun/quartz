# Use irony honestly
Rilke says to avoid irony in uncreative moments. In creative moments, it can be used as a means of grasping life. But irony can become a crutch when abused. To get out of this rut, work on serious subjects, because irony isn't a very apt tool for such a job. Rilke says, "Seek the depth of things: thither irony never descends."[^1]

![[Irony is the infinite absolute negativity]]

Post-postmodernism, or [[What is Performatism?]], is about sincerity over irony.[^2]
