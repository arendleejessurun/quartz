"When you write pretty much anything, you're essentially asking someone to read a musical score—to hear it in their head. So an attentiveness to sound and rhythm and meter is really useful to your aesthetic as somebody who's putting words on a page. It's pretty similar to putting notes on a staff, in its way." —James Hannaham
