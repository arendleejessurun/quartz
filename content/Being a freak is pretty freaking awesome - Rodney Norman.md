"You're never going to be 100% perfect right at first unless you're some sort of freak of nature. But you still might be a freak of nature. ... You probably are a freak of nature, but you're just not a freak at being perfect, and that's okay. Just being a freak is pretty freaking awesome." - [Rodney Norman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhdFYooMA8)
