# Illusion in literature
Illusion is the illustration of falsities[^1]—which is kind of like dramatic irony, but the reader is unawares rather just than the character(s). It can be a dream, vision, or other device that misleads or confuses a character.[^2]

Illusion may also refer to a reader's sense of immersion, as Wolfgang Iser writes about in [[The Reading Process—A Phenomenological Approach]].
