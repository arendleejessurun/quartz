# Betteridge's law of headlines
"Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word _no_."

If the writer is confident that the answer is yes, then it could and should be presented as an assertion. Asking the question removes a writer from taking and being clear about their own stance.^[ [Betteridge's law of headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines)]
