# How to tell a story
Every story must have a beginning, middle, and end. Tony Loyd uses the acronym SOAR:
- Scene
- Obstacles encountered 
- Action taken
- Resolution[^1]

Storyboard artist Emma Coats outlines a fairytale form as the following: "Once upon a time, there was (blank). Every day, (blank). One day, (blank). Because of that, (blank). Because of that, (blank). Until finally, (blank)."[^2]

Author John Gardner says, "A character wants something, goes after it despite opposition ... and so arrives at a win, lose, or draw."[^3]

If you're in the middle of your story, you can tell it as a pitch or a choose-your-own adventure: share where you've been, where you find yourself now, and where you may be in the future.[^4]

Make sure you know why tell the story.[^1] [[Why create?]]

Storytelling is effective when:
- You use a hook[^5]
- You stay on track[^1]—even simply writing in chronological order will captivate your audience[^5]
- You know your ending, the point you wish to make,[^1] who the message is for,[^5] and what central theme or plot point you're going for[^6]
- You embrace conflict and struggle[^6]
- You have a clear structure[^6]
- You [[Tell the truth]]
- You involve the reader/listener,[^1] what Ira Glass calls "bait"[^5] (see Also [[The Reading Process—A Phenomenological Approach]])
- You tell it with compassion
- You don't co-opt someone else's story (see [[Is this story only mine to share?]])

Fairytales break the rules of modern storytelling conventions, and the form can offer a nice reprieve. Kate Bernheimer says there are four features of fairytales: flatness (particularly flatness of character), abstraction (lack of details), intuitive logic (like dream logic, or surrealism, or magical realism), normalized magic. Lincoln Michel adds two more: open artifice, and a non-setting. Some of these features have some crossover with other genres.[^7]

However you tell it, remember [[Sharing your story is important]].
