# Be open to difficulty
Openness to experience, both the good and bad, is, as Kaufman and Gregoire say, the "strongest and most consistent personality trait that predicts creative achievement." Try something new or outside of your comfort zone.[^1]

Siri Sat Nam Singh says to Laura Jane Grace it may not be easy. Easy is a judgment and [[Judgment is a creativity thief]]. Instead of judging events by their ease, Laura chooses to remember it's a process and to even enjoy the process.[^2]

It's important to take courage and put away "shyness before any sort of new, unforeseeable experience with which one does not think oneself able to cope" because openness to difficulty also opens one up to spirituality.[^3]
