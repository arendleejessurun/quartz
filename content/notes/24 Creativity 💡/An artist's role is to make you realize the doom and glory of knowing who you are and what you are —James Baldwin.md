"An artist is a sort of emotional or spiritual historian. His role is to make you realize the doom and glory of knowing who you are and what you are. He has to tell, because nobody else in the world _can_ tell, what it is like to be alive. All I've ever wanted to do is tell that, I'm not trying to solve anybody's problems, not even my own. I'm just trying to outline what the problems are." —James Baldwin, found via [The Doom and Glory of Knowing Who You Are: James Baldwin on the Empathic Rewards of Reading and What It Means to Be an Artist – The Marginalian](https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/05/24/james-baldwin-life-magazine-1963/?mc_cid=b381bb61e1&mc_eid=515e154e71)
