# Critics are behind the times
Rilke says to [[Read as little as possible of aesthetic criticism]]. Critics are at last trying to apprehend and get with what artists are already doing. 

Reading about metamodernist philosophy and New Sincerity was weird. It was like these critics and philosophers were describing the culture that I was eating up as a kid, and I feeel like, yeah, I could've told you that.
