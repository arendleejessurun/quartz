# Having a voice is essential for a sustainable career
Your voice is what sets you apart from others, which creates audience connection, and this creates value.[^1] People will seek you out for who you are and what you do.[^2] When your work is valued, you get paid to keep making work, which allows you to keep honing your voice.[^1] Using your voice and being true to yourself is one way to practice [[Attraction, not promotion]].
