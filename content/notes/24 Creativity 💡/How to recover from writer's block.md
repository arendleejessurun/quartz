# How to recover from writer's block
Reframe it as a writer's hurdle, not a block. You've just got to get enough momentum to scale it. I think I heard this on Creative Pep Talk.

Oftentimes, [[Starting is the hardest part]].

Many creative blocks can be reframed as performance anxiety.[^1] Accept that [[Fear is a part of the creative process]]. You may also [[Overcome writer's block by focusing on mental health]]. If it's internalized messages of doubt that are the cause of your block, see [[How to deal with discouragement]]. 

[[Use your better judgment]]. [[Make what you like]].

[[Don't try to create and analyze at the same time]]. [[Edit your art later]], but [[Don't overcook it]]. Just put stuff down and [[Be willing to write a bad song]]. Mary Gauthier says she writes what she "sees" quickly, like the song is a wild animal. Coming to the song with scrutiny will scare it away.[^2] [[Don't coddle your song]] either. Both scrutiny and coddling are an anxiety that it won't be good without exerting your control. [[Begin again]].

[[Take a break from media]].
