# Get bored to get creative
Boredom is important for creativity. The mind at rest can create new ideas this way. This is the importance of [[Niksen]] or [[Doing nothing]]. Austin Kleon calls this "productive procrastination."[^1]

![[Boredom, for me, is a very good sign]]

In a study, people who first did a boring task later performed better at an idea-generating task than those who first did a craft activity.[^2] Doing a familiar, or boring, activity allows the mind to space out.[^3] Ruut Veenhoven says, "Even when we [[Niksen|niks]] our brain is still processing information and can use the available processing power to solve pending problems."[^4]

Paul Simon throws a ball at the wall. Monastics use prayer beads. Mix engineers [[Listen to an 80%-finished mix with a "soft gaze"]]. Doris Lessing takes breaks to do chores.[^3] For many, [[Walking is creative exercise]].

![[Avoiding work is the way to focus my mind]]

When I notice myself wanting to do something but not wanting to do any of the things that are on offer, or when I need some stimulation for my brain, that is a sign that I'm bored.[^3] Boredom and depression and neurodivergence seem interconnected then.

![[It turns out that bliss ... lies on the other side of crushing, crushing boredom.]]

Find ways to relax into boredom or the monotony of creative work.[^5] [[Take boredom as an invitation to rest]]. For me, that may be drinking tea, lighting incense, listening to music or a podcast. Alternatively, [[Take boredom as an invitation to try something new]].
