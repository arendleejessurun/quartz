# The hazards of quick success
Joe Pug in his interview with Caitlin Rose says famous people can get stuck at the maturity level at which they first had a massive success. He recounts an idea attributed to Bono that if you look up after 10 years at a dinner party, and you're surrounded by only people on your payroll, you're probably an asshole.[^1]

Why is this? [[Authentic feeling and experience destines us for our vocation]]. If this is so, those who pacify their suffering with worldly success do not learn from their suffering.

![[It is clear that we must hold to what is difficult]]

[[Enjoy the process]]. Brené Brown did at TEDTalk in her 40s and has now had success. Part of what makes her relatable is that she had had a normal life before that.[^3]

That makes me think of John Mulaney's joke about Mick Jagger demanding, "Coca Cola!"

[[Christopher Lee's advice for young actors]] is that it's dangerous to believe your own publicity.
