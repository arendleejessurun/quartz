# You can be well-adjusted and a great artist
There's this idea that great artists have to suffer. But everyone suffers. That is enough. You don't have to seek it out. If it was only great suffering that made great art, there'd be a lot more of it, frankly. The idea that artists have to be disturbed is a fraud.[^1] This is magical thinking.

The romantic mythos of the artist-addict perhaps came from Rufus Wilmot Griswold's expos√© of Edgar Allen Poe's drunken dysfunction, which inadvertently birthed a legend.[^2]

These days, substance abuse is not a common theme in fiction, but the addiction memoir, ending in recovery, is in vogue.[^2]
