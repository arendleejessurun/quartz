# How to navigate influences
- Get to know my influences. Read interviews. Ask them questions. Get to know their own influences. 
- Copy another artist. 
- Collect many influences and integrate it all together. Explore entire genres or movements.
- Make a list of my influences and why I admire their work. This may be included in [[My creative family tree]].
- Try spending a week off the internet and without books and create art from there.
- Study old movements or eras.[^1] [[Learn the tradition]].
