# Judgment is a creativity thief
![[With nothing can one approach a work of art so little]]

[[It's easier to critique than it is to create]]. Judging myself and others puts a damper on my creativity. It instills a notion of what is 'bad' art. Moreover, [[Dissing others' interests hampers creativity]].

[[Judgment is a poor tool in the hands of insecurity]]. Instead, [[Use your better judgment]].
