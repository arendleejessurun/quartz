# Four hours is a workday
Charles Darwin, mathematician Henri Poincaré, Thomas Jefferson, writer Alice Munro, writer John le Carré all worked for about 4 hours a day.[^1]

To make the most of your work time, work during your mental peaks, managing your energy, not your time. Then spend an equal amount of time at leisure. Plan your workday realistically, underestimating how much you can do, overestimating the time it will take, and overestimating interruptions that may come up.[^2]
