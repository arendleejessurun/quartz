# Authentic feeling and experience destines us for our vocation
Rilke says the more still, patient, and open one is, the more they will be able to receive the newness that this change is bringing into their life and prepare themselves for their destiny.[^1] 

Suffering can be a good teacher.

![[Suffering ... becomes something like a teacher]]

This is unlike [[The hazards of quick success]].

![[The moment you feel, you're nobody-but-yourself]]
