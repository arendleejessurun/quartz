# To find your voice, practice
![[The only way to find your voice —Austin Kleon]]

![[Just write a little bit every day]]

Finding your voice takes practice. Make a schedule for creative practice.[^1] [[When you don't have a gig, hire yourself as practice]].

![[Sometimes it take you a long time to sound like yourself —Miles Davis]]

[[Be willing to write a bad song]]. Reframe "failures" as experimentation.[^2] [[Consider everything an experiment]]. Every creative experiences a gap between their taste and skill.[^3]

[[What counts as showing up to songwriting?]]

![[You can only write regularly if you're willing to write badly]]

Create a ritual for writing. A ritual is different than a routine in that it is more intentional and less rigid.[^4] Steven Pressfield has a prayer he says before writing.[^5] When you do something everyday, starting is easier and less stressful because you're not cramming.[^6] Schedule art time everyday, and show up knowing [[Starting is the hardest part]]. Schedule rest time too to keep from [[Break in case of burnout|Burnout]].[^6]
