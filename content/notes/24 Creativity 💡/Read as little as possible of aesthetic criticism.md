# Read as little as possible of aesthetic criticism
This advice comes from Rilke. Aesthetic critiques are either partisan and indurate, or passing, teeter-tottering fads. Only love can grasp works of art.[^1] [[Judgment is a creativity thief]]. [[We know things by giving ourselves to them]].

W. H. Auden says something similar.
