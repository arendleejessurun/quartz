"In this sense, then, longing becomes not the craving for perfection—for the shimmer of glory, for the myth of closure, for the happily ever after—but a kind of tenderness for imperfection, for the recognition that the place between no more and not yet is the place where the chance-miracle of life lives itself through us, and that is a beautiful place." - Maria Popova, [The Power of the Bittersweet: Susan Cain on Longing as the Fulcrum of Creativity](https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/06/05/susan-cain-bittersweet/)
