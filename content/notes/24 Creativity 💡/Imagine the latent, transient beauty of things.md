# Imagine the latent, transient beauty of things
This is an idea that is expressed in [[YÅ«gen]].

Evelyn Underhill speaks about something similar: "our uneasiness, the vagueness of our reactions to things, would be cured could we reach and unite with the fact, instead of our notions of it."[^1] Again she asks, "Has it never happened to you to lose yourself for a moment in a swift and satisfying experience for which you found no name?"[^2] This kind of thing may open up a feeling of [[Sehnsucht]].
