# Don't try to create and analyze at the same time
This is rule eight of [[Corita Kent's ten rules for teachers and students]].

Separate your generative flow from your critical flow. These processes, if blurred together, can result in messy editing or writer's block.[^1]

![[There's nothing that can ruin a song I'm working on faster â€”Anna Tivel]]

Spencer Tweedy says part of the process is letting the mind quiet down and the gut take lead.[^2]

Either [[Edit your art later]] or [[Edit your art before you make it]]. What more, [[Don't be so precious about your art]], and [[Don't overcook it]].
