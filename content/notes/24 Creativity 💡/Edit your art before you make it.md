# Edit your art before you make it
This is the inverse of [[Edit your art later]]. Figure out your art philosophy. Discover what you like. Make decisions before you start making art. If art is play, you've gotta know the rules to be able to play the game.[^1] [[Limitations breed creativity]]. Work within templatesâ€”[[Self-plagiarism is style]]. Just be wary of letting it become formulaic, and [[Don't worry about having a style]].

I may like to look back at my songs and figure out which ones are my favorites (or which ones have landed an audience). Then I may start to see my style a little better. [[To find your voice, practice]] and [[Make what you like]].

Some people think working on your methodology is analysis paralysis, but I think it's all part of practicing. Musicians edit before they create by practicing their technique. Sure, [[Technique is not music]], but it can certainly help you make music. 

Lastly, understand [[Theory is for practice]] and then go make art!
