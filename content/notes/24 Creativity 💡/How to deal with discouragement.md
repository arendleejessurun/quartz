# How to deal with discouragement
Keep what I like to call a [[Rainy day file]]. What is the nicest thing anyone has ever said to you about your work?[^1] Austin Kleon calls this a praise file. Open it up when you need encouragement.[^2] Take compliments well, and don't be the kind of jerk that stomps all over someone's gift.[^3]

If you're feeling concerned your work is not unique enough, keep pushing past your first idea to find your own unique voice.[^4] And remember: [[Some writers confuse authenticity … with originality —W. H. Auden]], but being unique and authentic doesn't mean having to create something "original," whatever that means.

If you're worried no one cares about your art enough, keep caring about more art.

![[You can't not give it everything]]

If it's critical words you're dealing with, try one of the following:
- Kill them with kindness. Send a thank you letter back to the critic.[^5]
- Vent to an even-tempered friend.[^5]
- Collect rejection letters like trophies. Maybe make something funny of it.
- Have a friend edit the review, striking out anything of disfavor and correcting grammar.[^5]
- Remember that [[Critics are behind the times]].
- Remember that [[It's easier to critique than it is to create]].
- [[Remember why you make art]]—it's probably because you love it and it helps you love yourself!
- Some critiques boil down to something being unconventional or weird, but remember: [[Weird is wonderful]].
- "If they don't care what they say, why should I?"[^6]
- [[What we think is good is rather just familiar enough]].

If you're worried you're not having success quick enough, remember [[The hazards of quick success]].
