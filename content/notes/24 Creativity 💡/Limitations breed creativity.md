# Limitations breed creativity
Chet Faker said having all the money to buy every piece of gear he always wanted and more did not make him any more creative. In fact, it gave him too many options and distracted him from the process. He had more gear than he had time to do something with it. He prefers to work with a few pieces of equipment that he knows well.[^1]
