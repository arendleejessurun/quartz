"When I talk to young composers, I tell them, I know that you're all worried about finding your voice. Actually you're going to find your voice. By the time you're 30, you'll find it. But that's not the problem. The problem is getting rid of it." —Philip Glass, found via [Don’t worry about style - Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/2023/04/04/dont-worry-about-style/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)
