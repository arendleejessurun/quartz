"We usually define ourselves by what we do. ... The core of what we are is a human being. ... So music now, I look at it from the standpoint of being a human being and use that as the foundation." â€”[Herbie Hancock](https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/12/22/herbie-hancock-interview-buddhism-burnout/)
