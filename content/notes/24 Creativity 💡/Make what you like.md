# Make what you like
[[To find your voice, practice]]. Sort through all that you've created, and keep what you like and what feels like you.[^1] ([[What are my favorite songs I've written?]]) Don't just write what you know; write what you like.[^2] Deciding what you like means making a judgment, so [[Use your better judgment]].
