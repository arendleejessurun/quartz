# Edit your art later
Once you tell yourself an idea will never work, your brain may begin to filter other good ideas as bad ideas.[^1]

Consider creating and editing at different times of day or on different days.[^2] Many mix engineers recommend finishing a song, leaving it over night, then checking it the next morning to make any adjustments before sending it off.
