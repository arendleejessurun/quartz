"People have (with the help of conventions) oriented all their solutions toward the easy and toward the easiest side of the easy; but it is clear that we must hold to what is difficult; everything alive holds to it, everything in Nature grows and defends itself in its own way is characteristically and spontaneously itself, seeks at all costs to be so and against all opposition." - Rainer Maria Rilke, [[Letters to a Young Poet]] pg. 41
