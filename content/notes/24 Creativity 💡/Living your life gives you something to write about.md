# Living your life gives you something to write about
Writing about your life is good, but living your life is better, plus it gives you something to write about.[^1] Julia Cameron calls these "artist dates"—assigned play.[^2] I like to call them [[Practice little sabbaticals|Little sabbaticals]]. [[Play is creative fuel]]. [[What helps me connect with my inner child?]] These are some of my [[Artist date ideas]]. [[Creativity is not all output—it's input too]].

Richard Avedon says the work changes the life and the life changes the work. They are inseparable.[^3]
