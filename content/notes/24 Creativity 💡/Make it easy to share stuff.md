# Make it easy to share stuff
Andy J. Pizza on Creative Pep Talk says to use your "sawdust"—leftovers from your work that can easily be made into shareable material.[^1]

Another way to think about it is like Robin Sloan's concept of stock and flow in media. Stock is your best, most memorable work. Flow is the social media feed.[^2] Outflow comes from your stock, e.g. the flow of water from your stock in a bathtub.[^3]

[[When you have an insight, don't share it right away]].
