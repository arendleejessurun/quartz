"When someone between twenty and forty says, apropos of a work of art, 'I know what I like,' he is really saying 'I have no taste of my own but accept the taste of my cultural milieu,' because between twenty and forty, the surest sign that a man has genuine taste of his own is that he is uncertain of it. After forty, if we have not lost our authentic selves altogether, pleasure can again become what it was when we were children, the proper guide to what _we_ should read." â€”W. H Auden, [Auden on Writing, Originality, Self-Criticism, and How to Be a Good Reader](https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/08/10/auden-dyers-hand-reading-writing/?utm_source=pocket_mylist)
