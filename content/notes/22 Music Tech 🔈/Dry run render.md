# Dry run render
Use this to measure levels before final render. From the actions menu, run "Calculate loudness of master mix via dry run render." This yields measurements for peak, RMS-I, LRA, and LUFS-I.^[ [Calculate Loudness (LUFS) with Actions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAns9x_sDG8&t=21s)] I can use this alongside [[TheNormalizer]] to make sure I'm comparing my mix at the same level against my references.

I can also "Calculate loudness of selected tracks via dry run render" and even "Calculate mono loudness of selected tracks via dry run render" as a check against [[Phase cancellation]].
