# Creating realistic MIDI drums
Start with a great drum sample library.[^1] Something with a bleed control is key.[^2]

Drumming on the keyboard, instead of programming by hand, can help add a human touch. Some kits have redundant mappings, making 16ths easier to play in both hands.[^3]

For snares, vary center hits and rim shots, especially for rock.[^2]

Hi hat and ride cymbal velocities can really help something sound more realistic.[^4]

Bring down kick velocities at the end of the pattern to essentially make it into a ghost note.[^4]

Don't quantize things too hard.[^1] If a real drummer hits two things, the will be a flam.[^2] You can also use Humanize (see [[Reaper MIDI editor]]).

Record ghost notes and don't quantize them.[^5] Ghost notes can be written in 32nd notes.[^6]

Learning how to drum will help. For instance, don't program crashes and hi hats on the same beats.[^5] Remember, if you're playing real drums, you only have two hands.[^7]

Disable the processing on the inside of the virtual drums so you can you your own processing.[^8] In my experience, MIDI drums can often sound over-processed, which takes away from the realism.

Compress the drum room track—if your drum software has it—to add liveliness.[^5] You can also add room samples for each drum after the fact (see [[Drum replacement and augmentation]]).[^1]

For more inspiration, see [[Records that have used programmed drums]].
