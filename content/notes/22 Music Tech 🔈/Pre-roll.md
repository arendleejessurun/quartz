# Pre-roll
Right-click metronome to enable pre-roll. You can also pull the punch back to reveal any audio captured during pre-roll.^[ [Recording During Audio Pre Roll - v5.33 in REAPER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D81EZvdxJjA)]

To emulate pre-roll for loop record, right-click record button and select "Auto punch selected items." Then set up time selection loop for the amount of pre-roll you want. This only works if there is an item there. If there isn't, create a time selection and then from the top toolbar click Insert > Empty item.^[ [Loop Recording With Pre-Roll in REAPER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdX6S5GmdhQ)]
