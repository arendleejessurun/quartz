# Quantizing bass
1. [[Dynamic split]].
2. [[How to quantize with Reaper]] to taste.
3. [[Fill gaps between selected items]]. [[Use a leading pad to create a smoother quantization|Use a leading pad]] of 5-20ms to create a backward temporal mask (see [[How to mask time edits]]).

## Other tips
To save the release of bass notes without doing much editing with traditional quantization, try using stretch algorithms.[^1]

I'm not sure I want to do it this way though.

Reaper's [[How to quantize with Reaper]] menu has an option "Quantize item ends and stretch item to fit," which could be useful for bass.[^2] This could be the best of both worlds. [[Fill gaps between selected items]] also has a similar function.
