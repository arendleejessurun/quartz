# KRK Rokit 5 Analysis
Audio Science Review did an analysis of the speaker [here](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/krk-rokit-5-gen-4-review-studio-monitor.20711/). This concludes some port interference at 680. The ported frequency is out of phase with the speaker, causing a notch at that frequency. Crossover around 3k is not perfect, causing some directivity nonlinearities. The waterfall graph shows some other resonances around 270, 350, 520 (maybe these are harmonics?), 680 (port resonance), 1.5k (maybe crossover?), 1.8k, 4-5k.

After [[Testing speakers' low frequency response]], I've found resonances at
