# Balancing workflow
- Set a timer for 25 mins
- Try [[Multing can solve problems and create contrast|multing]] anything that may need it early
- Gain stage submixes at 0dB VU (see [[How to gain stage]])
	- Mix tracks within submix relative to one another
- Mix submixes together to 2bus at 0dB VU
- Optionally convert fader settings to a gain plugin
- Mute anything unnecessary
- High-pass
- Compress anything that needs it
- Mute and add submixes back in order of importance
- Check phase of multi-mic setups (see [[How to adjust phase]])
- Applying track [[Panning]]
- EQ to fix masking
	- Start with shelving cuts, then bell cuts (see [[Why I prefer EQ cuts for balancing]])
- Switch the newly balanced track in and out to listen for any other masked frequencies

I borrowed some techniques from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFts78Cxy7g).
