# Sidechaining kick and bass
If a wideband compressor isn't working, try a multiband or spectral compressor.[^1] However, wideband sidechain compression may work better in the case that you've added considerable harmonics, or if your track already has it there.[^2]

A gate can also be used for ducking.[^2]

Another option is to simply volume automate or mute sections of certain parts.[^3]
