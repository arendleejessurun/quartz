# Kick drum EQ guide
The two points of interest are the fundamental and the beater attack.[^1]

Consider using a subharmonic synthesizer at 30-40Hz to beef up the kick.[^2]

Cutting 200Hz can help the fundamental shine through.[^3]

Cut the mid-range to get rid of that hollow, basketball sound. The kick doesn't need to take up this range, which will be more important for other instruments.[^1] There's typically ugly frequencies between 250-400Hz,[^4] even up to 500Hz.[^5] Don't be afraid to aggressively cut here. Cut somewhere around 360-800Hz for rock.[^6]

Carve out a few dB at 80-100Hz to make space for [[Mixing bass]].[^2]

Boost the fundamental, which is often around 80Hz, maybe even the sub below that octave too.[^1]

Keep the low-mids, which is important for translation on small speakers.[^1]

The knock sound is usually around 1kHz, give or take a few hundred Hz.[^7]

The beater attack is in the highs, somewhere around 2k-8kHz[^1], depending on style (heavy styles use a higher freq attack).[^6] [[Use a parallel high band to add intelligibility]].
