# Start mixing the drums with bus processing
After achieving level balance and any corrective EQ or other processing, then compress and EQ the entire drum buss (see [[Bus processing]]), treating them as a single instrument. If it needs any other processing, you can go into the individual tracks and work on them.[^1]

Try using [[VCA compression]], like an API or SSL, for the drum buss, or [[Tube compression]] or [[Diode-bridge compression]] for different warm to gritty flavors.[^2] Use sidechain EQ so the drum buss compressor doesn't clamp down on the lows.[^3]
