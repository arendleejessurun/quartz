# EQ your reverb sends
You may want to EQ the reverb to make sure it isn't causing [[Frequency masking]]. Bypass the reverb for a bit to listen for this.[^1] Most of the time, a cut around 300Hz is beneficial.[^2] This is especially helpful for vocal intelligibility.[^3] A low pass or high shelving cut can also make the reverb more inconspicuous.[^2]

The Abbey road technique is to use a low and high-pass filter before the reverb. Dave Pensado cuts at 600Hz and 6kHz, essentially creating a telephonic bandpass, and then also takes out 1.2kHz with a bell cut.[^4] Abbey Road engineers cut at 500Hz and 10,000Hz before sending to a reverb.[^5]

EQing reverb before and after can add a great, tucked-in effect.[^6]
