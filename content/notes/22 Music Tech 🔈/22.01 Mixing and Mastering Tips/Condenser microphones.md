# Condenser microphones
Condensers are powered, removing the need to move a heavy coil, as in the design of [[Dynamic microphones]]. This allows them to capture more subtle detail. An adverse affect of this is they can pick up extraneous sound and potentially undesirable room reflections.[^1] Most common in studios.[^2]

Best suited for vocals, drum overheads, acoustic instruments, room microphones.

They are also more fragile.[^1]

There are tube and FET condensers. FETs tend to be brighter.[^1]
