# Record at 24-bit at least
If you record at 16-bit, and peak at -12dB, you're only using 14 bits, representing only 16,384 quantization steps. Having higher bit-depth is especially important for dynamic material with occasional low-level signals.[^1]

What bit depth does GarageBand record at? 24-bit is the default.[^2]
