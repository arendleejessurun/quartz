# How to adjust phase
Nudge multi-tracked or otherwise doubled parts so the waveforms align. Check polarity too.

Reaper has a cool feature where you can see transparent waveforms stacked on top of one another if the two tracks are under a folder track.[^1]

Pan two elements hard left and right and use a correlometer to see where in the frequency spectrum something is out of phase. Follow that with a phase adjustment plugin to address phase in the frequency region.[^2] You can also look at the two waveforms with an oscilloscope. This can also be used to align the phase of the kick and bass together.

All-pass filters can also be used to rotate phase at a corner frequency.

[[JS Stereo Field Manipulator]] has a phase rotator. There's also [[JS Phase Rotator]].
