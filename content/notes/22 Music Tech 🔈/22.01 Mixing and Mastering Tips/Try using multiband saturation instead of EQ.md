# Try using multiband saturation instead of EQ
Multiband saturation can do a similar thing as EQ boosts, but as a bonus, it adds harmonic content and density as well.[^1]

If you're boosting the low-end, but it gets boomy or muddy before you get the weight you want, or if you're boosting the high-end, but it gets harsh before you get the airiness you want, this may be a sign to reach for some saturation on those bands.[^2]

Mike Senior recommends this approach too in [[Mixing Secrets for the Small Studio]].

Parallel distortion can be used for a similar effect. You can use filters to focus the distortion on certain frequencies.[^3]

I like using [[Saturn 2]] as an exciter. [[SlickEQ GE]] does something similar by adding harmonics as it boosts. [[Volcano 3]] can add saturation on its bands too.
