## Tips and tricks
I really love the timbre knob. Cranking it toward hifi adds a nice sheen.

Can do dual mono.

Mk3 is really great for bringing acoustic guitar to life.

Mk3 also makes a really great vocal leveler, Mk1 too. I might even prefer it over [[Pro-C 2]] for leveling.

Using Mk1, with timing 1 and set to limit, you can get it to do a Fairchild kind of thing.[^2]

### Models
- Mk1 is really pillowy. I like it for a retro 60s and earlier kick sound. The controls look a lot like a Fairchild. This is based on variable-mu compressors from the 50s.[^1] It's good for warming up stuff and may be useful for [[Compressing vocals]] (though not as warm as [[Molot GE]]).
- Mk2 is based on the 175 and 176 from the early 1960s, the all-tube-predecessors of the 1176 FET compressor.[^1] Much faster than Mk1. Has a little more mid focus than Mk1.
- Mk3 has the most hi-fi sound.
