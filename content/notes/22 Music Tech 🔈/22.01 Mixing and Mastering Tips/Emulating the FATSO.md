# Emulating the FATSO
The FATSO is often used to warm up digital recordings. The FATSO emulates [[Tape saturation]], does high-frequency compression, creates low-frequency harmonics, and does leveling compression.[^1] Marc Daniel Nelson says the warmth circuit is basically like a de-esser.[^3]

For the first process, try something like [[Satin]] or [[Wow Control]].

For the second process, try something like the high-frequency limiter on [[Limiter 6]].[^2] Empirical Labs call it a dynamic low-pass filter, which I could make in [[Volcano 3]].[^1]

For the third process, try something like a low-mid band with [[Saturn 2]] using one of its transformer modes.

Finish it off with a leveling compressor like [[MJUC]] or [[Pro-C 2]].
