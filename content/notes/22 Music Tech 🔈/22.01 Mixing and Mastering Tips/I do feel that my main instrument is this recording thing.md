"People ask you, 'What do you play?' and then I always say, 'I play keyboards.' ... But I do feel that my main instrument is this recording thing, which doesn't have a nameâ€”or production, which sounds grander than what it is. But that's where my musicality began and that's still where it is." - Yuka Honda, [[Mirror Sound]] pg. 59
