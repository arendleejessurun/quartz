# Fletcher-Munson curve
We're most sensitive to 3.5kHz. This is the resonant frequency of the ear canal.[^1] This is also approximately the frequency of a baby's cry.[^2] In music school, I learned this is about where the singer's formant is. 

We're most sensitive to 1-5kHz. This is where consonants live. As the reference level flattens, we hear frequencies fairly evenly.[^1]

The curves show us that if 1kHz is played at 20dBSPL, 100Hz would have to be played at 50dBSPL.
