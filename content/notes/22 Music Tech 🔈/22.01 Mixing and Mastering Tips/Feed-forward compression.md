# Feed-forward compression
As opposed to [[Feedback compression]], feed-forward detection circuits precede the gain-reduction circuit.[^1] They anticipate the signal getting too loud, creating a "snappy" or "grabby" sound.[^2] These require additional controls for threshold, attack, and release to be useful.[^1]

The dbx 160 is a classic example[^1] (it's also RMS-sensing).[^3] Many modern compressions from the [[VCA compression]] era onward are feed-forward.[^1]

[[Molot GE]] and [[DC8C3]] can do feed-forward compression.
