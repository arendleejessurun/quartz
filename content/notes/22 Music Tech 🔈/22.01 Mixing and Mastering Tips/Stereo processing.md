# Stereo processing
- [[Use short delays for stereo width]]
- [[Creating a fake double track]]
- [[Use a graphic EQ for stereo widening]]
- [[Classic pitch-shift delay effect]]
- [[Use mid-side EQ for hard-panned double tracks]]
- [[Use mid-side delay for added depth]]
- [[Take care using stereo delay on mono signals]]
- [[Use different high-pass filters on the left and right channel]]
- [[Hard-pan and widen non-essential sounds]]
- [[Invert the polarity of one track before saturation]]
- [[Use mid-side nonlinear processing]]
- [[Use binaural effects as an alternative to panning]]
- [[Use a holographic sound on the mixbus]]
