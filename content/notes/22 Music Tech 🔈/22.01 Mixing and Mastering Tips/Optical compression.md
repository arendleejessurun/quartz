# Optical compression
Optical compressors have a slower attack, controlled by light.[^1] They have a frequency-dependent attack time[^2] and react based on RMS rather than peaks.[^3] The LA2A is the most famous optical compressor.[^2] The LA3A is similar, but valveless.[^4]

These sound great on vocals and bass, especially when doing just a few decibels of gain reduction,[^5] but they can also compress a lot without it being so obvious.[^3] They can, however, be susceptible to pumping if a loud spike is fed into them.[^2]

Using RMS compression with lookahead can simulate opto.[^6] [[Kotelnikov GE]]'s Inertia mode is similar to optical compression. [[LALA]] is an LA2A emulation. I like [[Pro-C 2]]'s optical mode. [[MTurboComp]] does an LA2A.

Mike Clink, Mark Endert, Tony Maserati, Jim Scott, and Rick Beato[^7] all like an LA2A on bass.[^4] Beato likes an LA2A and acoustic guitar and an LA3A clean guitars.[^7] Serge Tsai and Glen Ballard like the LA2A for how warm and gentle it is on vocals. When pushed, the LA2A can distort nicely, say Joe Chiccarelli and Joe Barresi.[^4]
