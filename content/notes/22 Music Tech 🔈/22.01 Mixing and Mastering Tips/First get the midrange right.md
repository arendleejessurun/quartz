# First get the midrange right
As demonstrated by the [[Fletcher-Munson curve]], the mids change very little at different volumes, leading many to believe that the mids are key to a balanced mix. From here, you can treat lows and highs as extensions of the midrange.[^1]

Mix on NS10s or a Mix Cube, which emphasize the mids.[^2] 

Alex Tumay, Jaycen Joshua, and Michael Brauer agree that 300Hz is "where the song is."[^3]

Gregory Scott says 800Hz is the foundation of the midrange. This can give a mix some "sea legs."[^4]

Jack Joseph Puig says the soul is in the midrange. Start your mix just focusing between 200-4kHz.[^5] Pay special attention to 1k-5kHz. Boost instruments not just at 4k-5kHz, but also 1k-2kHz.[^6]

CLA says that the subs take care of themselves if he gets everything else right. Low-end power comes from the low mids.[^6] This may be an example of [[Don't boost what you can't hear]].
