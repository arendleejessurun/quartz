# Sigur Rós vocal sampler effect
To simulate the sound of the Yamaha, use a bitcrusher and bandpass on the sample.^[ [How to make a Sigur Ros style Lo-Fi sampled vocal sound on the Yamaha VSS-30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyxKDLVWL28)] Jónsi also says, "there's an effect where you can reverse the sample and make a U-turn."^[ [Recording Sigur Ros](https://www.soundonsound.com/people/recording-sigur-ros)]

The VSS-30 is 8-bit and its sample rate is 8.9-16.7 kHz sample rate.^[ [Yamaha | VSS-30](http://www.synth-db.com/synths/Yamaha/VSS-30/VSS-30.php)]

Look into samplers that could make this easy.

[[ReaSamplOmatic 5000]] can change the resample quality for more lofi fun.

In Reaper I can right-click > item settings and reverse. By gluing the regular and reversed sample, I can emulate the VSS-30 U-turn.
