# Tube compression
Tube, or variable-mu, compressors also have a slow attack,[^1] controlled by a vacuum tube. The ratio of gain reduction increases as the level increases (reminds me of [[Pro-C 2]]'s vocal mode). These were the first compressor design, created in the '50s.[^2] The Fairchild 670 is the most famous example.[^3] The Fairchild is made up of 20 valves and 14 transformers.[^4]

Tube compression works kind of like sandpaper, for smoothing things out.[^5] They are particularly well-suited for gluing buses and mixes or for giving an extra push when dynamics are already nearly-perfect.[^6] They also work nicely for [[Compressing bass]].[^4]

I like [[MJUC]] best for tube compression. [[MTurboComp]] also does a Fairchild as well as a Manley Vari-Mu. Reaper's [[Fairly Childish Compressor]] is based on a Fairchild.

Rick Beato likes Fairchild 660 on bass or piano. He also uses it on vocals.[^7] Geoff Emerick, Steve Churchyard, and Tom Elmhirst like to run vocals through it more for the sound than the compression. Steve Churchyard, Tom Elmhirst, Manny Marroquin, and Elliott Scheiner like to use the Fairchild on drums too, following after Emerick who recorded Ringo with a Fairchild.[^4]
