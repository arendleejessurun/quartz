# Acoustic guitar EQ guide
Acoustic guitars often have annoying mid-range resonances.[^1]

High-pass around 75Hz, wherever the fundamental is. Balance the low-mid and high-mids.[^2] Warren Huart follows the high-pass with a slight boost at the fundamental.[^3]

Acoustic guitars can be boomy around 200Hz. Notch out any resonances in the low end.[^4] Consider balancing this by high shelf boosting. Maybe [[Follow up an aggressive high shelf boost with a low-pass filter]]. Maybe [[Use a de-esser to tame high end]]. See also [[Softening digital transients]]. 

Acoustic guitars can also sound congested and cheap around 800Hz. A dip here can be helpful.[^4]

It's common that mid-range resonances will pop up at each octave. If 300hz is over powering, 600hz, 1.2khz, 2.4khz, etc. may need addressing too.[^2] Alternatively, try a harmonic series cut. MPL made a script for [[ReaEQ]] to do this.

Bring out the mids around 2k-2.6k.[^5]

A boost around 8k can enliven the guitar too.[^4] Marc Daniel Nelson [[Boost the highs on the side and the lows on the mid|Boosts and expands the highs on the side]].[^7] F. Reid Shippen does a boost at 11.5kHz followed by a low-pass at 8.5kHz on a Neve 88Rs, which helps it cut through.[^6]
