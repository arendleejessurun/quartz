# Practice listening with an excerpt set
Pick 20 albums you enjoy and a single track from each, then cut a random 20 seconds from each. Put these into your DAW and cross fade them into one another. Notice how each mix sounds in succession with others. Which ones do you think sound best?[^1]

I like warmth and low mids, even as far down as 600Hz. I don't like too much high mids, particularly 1.5k-4kHz. I like some high sheen, but "Golden Age" is pushing it. I like a snare with some 10kHz snap. I don't like the vocal too forward. I like the sound of dynamics on acoustic stuff, but I like rock to be a little hugged. I like the Ed Cherney, Nigel Godrich, Tom Schick, Chris Shaw, Shawn Everett mixes. Compare this with [[Mixing engineers I admire]].
