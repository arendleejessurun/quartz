# Use a parallel high band to add intelligibility
Using a parallel high band yields more control, like adding a compressor or de-esser. This is useful for vocal "air."[^1] The [[Dolby A mod trick]] does something similar. Mike Senior also notches out problematic sibilant frequencies here. He will also add stereo enhancement by using either a short reverb or a [[Classic pitch-shift delay effect]].[^1]

On a kick, use a high-pass around 3kHz, so only the attack comes through. This also works well for toms.[^2]

See [[EQing multi-mic setups and parallel EQ]].
