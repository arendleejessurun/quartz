# Softening digital transients
Recording to tape tames acoustic guitar's transients nicely. Here's how Marc Daniel Nelson does so ITB:
- Subtle tape emulation
- Dynamic EQ to tame low mid resonance and shrill transients in the high mids
- Subtle compression for color, at loudest 1dB
	- Marc uses [[MJUC]] MkII with a 4:1 ratio and a medium-slow attack and fast release, only compressing about .5dB
- Remove some attack with a transient designer (this has the added benefit of nestling the guitar back in the mix, as discussed in [[Shaping transients to create depth]]).[^1]

Other ideas are:
- Tube or transistor saturation, or something that has a low [slew rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slew_rate).[^2] [[Presswerk]] has a warmth control that can do something like this.
- Clipping
- Phase rotation, like [[Volcano 3]] or [[JS Phase Rotator]].[^3] [[Presswerk]] also has a phase rotator.
- RX de-click[^4]
