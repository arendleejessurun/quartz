# Shelving filters are more phase-transparent than peaking filters
Shelving filters create less phase shift than peaking filters, as demonstrated in [[Pro-Q 3]]. They also cause less crest factor increase than peaking filter when they are matched to reduce at the same frequency.

However, they are not as useful as peaking filters for offsetting crest factor increase caused by HPFs (see [[Have no fear about high-pass filtering]]).
