# VCA compression
VCA compressors are the most versatile, with independent attack, release, threshold, and ratio controls,[^1] and they are especially well-suited for dealing with transients.[^2] They tend to be transparent.[^3] Most digital compressors are based on the VCA design.[^1] The SSL G Series, Distressor, dbx 160, and API 2500[^4] are popular VCA compressors.[^5]

They can also transform energy, like FETs. They may be likened to a CNC machine.[^6] These are great for percussion and [[Parallel compression]].[^2] [[Molot GE]] does a nice VCA kind of thing. [[DC8C3]] Snap mode is like a VCA. [[MTurboComp]] does an SSL Bus, Distressor, and dbx 160. It seems [[Pro-C 2]]'s Bus mode is VCA-inspired. Reaper's [[Major Tom Compressor]] is inspired by a dbx 160.

Steve Churchyard, Humberto Gatica, Eddie Kramer, Ed Cherny, and Mike Clink use a dbx on vocals for how clean they are.[^4] Rick Beato likes to use a dbx or SSL on kick and snare. He also sometimes uses a Distressor on snare and SSL on toms.[^7] Tom Lordâ€‘Alge, Jack Joseph Puig, and Butch Vig, and Glen Ballard like the dbx on drums. Michael Brauer, Joe Chiccarelli, Fabian Marasciullo, and Robert Orton like to use a Distressor on drums, especially for parallel processing.[^4]
