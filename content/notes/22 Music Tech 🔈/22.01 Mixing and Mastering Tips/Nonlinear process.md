# Nonlinear process
A nonlinear process is one in which changes in the output are not proportionately linked to changes in the input. Most systems in nature are inherently nonlinear.[^1] We love saturation in part because it's imperfect, as I wrote about in [[Natural beauty is imperfect]].

Dynamics processing like compression and expansion are also nonlinear. Compression and expansion attempts to do nonlinearity without distortion.[^2]

A system is linear if is both homogenous (output is proportional to input) and additive (e.g. a high-pass filter and low-pass filter = a band pass filter = a low-pass and a high-pass filter).[^3]

Modulation and automation turns any linear system to a nonlinear system.[^3]
