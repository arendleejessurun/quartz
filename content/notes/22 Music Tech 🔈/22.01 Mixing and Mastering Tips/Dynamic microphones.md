# Dynamic microphones
Dynamic microphones use a magnet to translate sound to voltage. They use the same principle as speakers, but in reverse. "A small movable induction coil, positioned in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet, is attached to the diaphragm."[^1]

They can take a lot of energy without being damaged. They're best suited for loud sources,[^2] like guitar amplifiers, loud vocals, snare drums, kick drums, and toms.[^3] Because they're less sensitive, they don't pick up much extraneous sound, like passing cars or other instruments in a live setting.[^2] It's also uncommon for these to respond linearly to all frequencies. They're usually designed to suit a particular frequency range.[^1]
