# What is RMS volume?
RMS, or root mean square, is a practical way to determine the average level of the signal, and it's close to how our ears perceive loudness.[^1]

RMS is the square root of the mean square.[^2] The mean square is the mean of the squares of a set of numbers.[^3] RMS squares the values, averages those values over a period of time, then finds the square root of that.[^4]

Why RMS? Simply averaging the values would not be helpful, since most signals vary between positive and negative, making the average usually around zero.[^5]

RMS is also known as the [quadratic mean](https://brilliant.org/wiki/quadratic-mean/) in arithmetic.[^5]
