# Sidechain gate the overheads to add snare ambience
Instead of using a snare reverb, try using the source ambience of the overheads. Set up a gate on the overheads to trigger whenever the close mic snare hits, using the detector high and low-pass. Then fade in this gated signal with the dry signal overheads signal.[^1] You can also try this with a room mic signal.
