# Andrew Scheps' big toms effect
Use this technique to get big toms.[^1]

- First remove any cymbal bleed
- Reverb with pre-delay and long decay, a nonlinear reverb
- Subtle chorus to give it a PA stadium thing

Before sending to a reverb, Andrew does the following:[^2]

- Scoop the mids
- Boost bass and treble
- Boost into a limiter
