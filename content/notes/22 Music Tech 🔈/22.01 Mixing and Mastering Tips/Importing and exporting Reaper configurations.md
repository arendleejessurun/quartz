# Importing and exporting Reaper configurations
Go to Preferences>General and click "Export configuration."^[ [Importing & Exporting Configurations in REAPER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB4C3njFxRg)]

Or do so manually by clicking Options>Show REAPER resource path in explorer/finder.^[ [How to delete / reset REAPER settings and preferences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4poXC3XtiQM&t=341s)] 

Export mouse modifiers at Preferences>Mouse Modifiers. This is also saved in reaper-mouse.ini.

Actions can be exported from the action list window. All this is saved in reaper-kb.ini.

SWS preferences are stored in S&M.ini. SWS auto color/icon is saved under. sws-autocoloricon.ini.

From the "Export configuration" window, I can also find other settings I may want to manually export.
