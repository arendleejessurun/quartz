# Pro-C 2 and RVox
One YouTube commenter said, "A fun fact is that the vocal mode in Fabfilter Pro-C 2 (when set to 0ms attack) is almost identical to Waves RVox. Fabfilter hasn't stated anywhere that the vocal mode is supposed to be inspired by RVox (at least not that I'm aware of), but the transfer function matches perfectly. The only difference is that the Pro-C 2 vocal mode has a bit shorter release even when set as long as possible. Maybe it could be that they are both inspired by the same hardware? I have no idea, just thought that it was an interesting fact."[^1]

Billy Decker says -17 is the sweet spot for the threshold.[^2]
