# Tape saturation
The term "saturation" comes from things like tape, where all the magnetic particles are pointing the same way and can't possibly take anymore signal, and likewise for a transformer.[^1]

Just turning on a tape machine emulator adds brightness via the the second and third order harmonics generated by the tape machine's amplifier.[^2]

The distortion point of tape is based on frequency as well as amplitude. As you push it, it will first start clipping the high frequencies. This makes tape useful for [[Controlling harsh high end]]. Slower tape speeds have less high frequency.[^2]

Within the linear range of tape, you don't get a clean low-frequency response. A bias signal is a super-sonic signal that puts energy into the tape so there's something that is adding dynamic range. Then adding in your recorded signal, you get more of a linear response. By turning the bias up, you get a larger dynamic range, but the high frequencies start clipping even earlier ([[Satin]] has a bias knob, as does [[Chow Tape Model]]).[^2]

By boosting the highs before going to tape, you can excite them even more.[^2] [[Satin]]'s pre-emphasis does just this.
