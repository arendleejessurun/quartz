# StandardGATE

## Tips and tricks
The tolerance control is for hysteresis.[^1]

Can do [[Upward expansion]].

Has a ducking mode that works with the sidechain.

Can do [[Mid-side processing]] and [[Stereo processing]].[^2]

Transient detector mode is useful for boosting transients, especially when using the dry/wet control.[^3] This can be used for removing transients too, by engaging the invert polarity button.[^4]

The de-bleed filter is useful to removing hi-hat bleed from snare.[^5]
