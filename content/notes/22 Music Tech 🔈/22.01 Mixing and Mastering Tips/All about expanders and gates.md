# All about expanders and gates
Attack time is the amount of time it takes for a signal to return or "open" up to its original volume.[^1]

Release time is the amount of time it takes to complete its gain reduction or "close" once the signal has dropped below the threshold.[^1]

Hysteresis controls the release. E.g.: a gate threshold of -18dB with attack at that threshold, and a hysteresis of -6dB will add that value to the threshold, making it release at a threshold of -24dB.[^2]

Reaper has a couple JS plugins for downward as well as [[Upward expansion]].
