# Why I prefer EQ cuts for balancing
EQ changes introduce phase changes around the center frequency, which themselves create tonal changes by way of comb filtering.[^1] Boosting makes the tonal changes that result from phase change more noticeable, whereas cutting can do the opposite.[^2] Cutting also concentrates the phase shifts on regions that aren't as crucial. These phase shifts can smear transients too.[^3] (See [[Shaping transients to create depth]].) Cutting also concentrates pre- or post-ringing on those less crucial areas.[^4]

Use cuts in combination with fader adjustments to address frequency imbalances and [[Frequency masking]]. Boosts (by their very nature of making things louder) can be deceptive and more easily obfuscate whether your settings are right.[^5] Auto-gain can help this is some cases, but be wary of relying upon it.

All that being said, [[Less is more when it comes to EQ]], so doing several cuts to achieve the same effect as one boost may not be the best idea.

[[Mixing on headphones]] may be most useful for making cuts at resonant frequencies, this way you aren't mistakenly hearing room resonances.
