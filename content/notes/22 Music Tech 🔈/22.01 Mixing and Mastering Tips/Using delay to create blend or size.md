# Using delay to create blend or size
In the same way that [[Reverb can be used to create blend]] and [[Reverb can be used to create size]], so can delay. Set up a true-stereo delay (such that the stereo positioning of the delays matches the soundstage) to act as the "room."^[ [[Mixing Secrets for the Small Studio]] pg. 302]

Add an aggressive limiter to this delay to increase sustain and grit.^[ [How to create a big drum room with plugins. Make your drums sound bigger and wider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Itz-N6LUs28&list=PL1sNd-gBgKcokKS0v14HYieHxmHsQS38V&index=3)]
