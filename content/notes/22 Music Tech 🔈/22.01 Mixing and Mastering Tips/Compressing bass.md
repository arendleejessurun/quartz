# Compressing bass
Use [[Optical compression]] or [[Tube compression]].

[[Upward compression]] is useful for keeping up the energy of the fundamental.[^1] I sometimes do this on the low band of my [[Split bass technique]].

Low E on bass is ~41Hz. [[Attack and release for bass frequencies]]. 121ms
