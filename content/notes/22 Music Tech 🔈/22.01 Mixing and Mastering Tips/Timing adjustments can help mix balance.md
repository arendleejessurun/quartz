# Timing adjustments can help mix balance
A drum hit that's out of time will stick out of the mix, but one that is in time will be masked more. This can be used to tuck elements into the mix, or bring them out.[^1] As Mike Senior demonstrates, nudging or delaying an overlapping percussive element can help it suffer less masking.[^2]
