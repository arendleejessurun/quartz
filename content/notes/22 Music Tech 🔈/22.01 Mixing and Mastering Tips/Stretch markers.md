# Stretch markers
[Vocal Alignment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr7cyy-lxgM)
- Add stretch marker at cursor: shift+w or opt+cmd+click
- Slide stretch marker: ctrl+left drag
- Delete stretch marker: opt+left click

Use [[Dynamic split]] to create stretch markers automatically.

Stretch markers can snap to the grid. 

To quantized stretch markers, select the item then right-click and choose Stretch markers > Stretch markers in selected items > Snap to grid.^[ [Stretch Markers in REAPER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMg_3AI6MKo)] I've set keyboard shortcut opt + q to perform this action.
