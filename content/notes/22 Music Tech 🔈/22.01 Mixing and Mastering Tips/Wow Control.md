# Wow Control

## Tips and tricks
[[Tape saturation]], wow, and flutter emulation.

Use if you need more distortion and wow/flutter than [[Satin]] can offer.

I like its saturation a lot on [[Mixing electric guitar|Electric guitar]].

## CPU
0.1-0.3% depending on OS

## Oversampling IR
Less post-ring than [[Satin]]

## Sine sweep test at -18, spectrograph readings at -130dB, OS on
200% saturation, better anti-aliasing than [[Satin]]

## Hammerstein test
Saturation at 100%
More even harmonics than [[Saturn 2]]'s tape.
