# Put a header and a footer on your mixes
Billy Decker starts with doing a master fade at the end and then a short pre-roll "header" as well as a "footer."[^1] This will help me do renders too, because I can just grab one track that has the right length, make a marquee selection, and render.

Billy also does this to allow the client to come in and sit in the mixer chair to they can press play and listen in the sweet spot.[^1]
