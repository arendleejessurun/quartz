# Use an exciter to reduce masking
Saturation can have the effect of muddling the lower frequencies of a sound source, but by saturating the highs, this increases harmonics in that region, which can be helpful for differentiating sounds.[^1]

I've used [[Wave Box]] with the frequency and resonance to help certain harmonics come out.
