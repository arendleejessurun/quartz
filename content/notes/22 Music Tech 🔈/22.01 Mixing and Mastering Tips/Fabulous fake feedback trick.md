# Fabulous fake feedback trick
Use an instance of a feedback compressor outputting to the sidechain, then key a serial compressor to that sidechain. This is useful for [[ReaComp]] and [[DC8C3]], who only go up to 2:1 compression in feedback mode. You can also play around with different attack and release settings in both compressors.[^1]
