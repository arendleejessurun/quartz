# Setting compressor attack and release
Attack time, simply put, is the amount of time it takes for the compressor to reach full gain reduction. A compressor begins compressing immediately, but it takes some time to wind up.[^1] An attack time of 100ms or greater will have a pumping effect on transient material with low-level stuff in it.[^2]

Release time, simply put, is the amount of time it takes to return to unity gain.[^1] A release time of 100ms or greater with have a breathing effect.[^2]

With this in mind, anything equal or greater than 100ms can be considered slow, and anything less can be considered fast.[^3]

These time constants usually work logarithmically.[^4] I can check the step transfer curves in Plugin Doctor.

Temporarily crank a compressor's threshold and ratio to better hear the effects of attack and release.[^5]

Use an oscilloscope to see how it changes.

Attack is how long it takes to apply compression. A fast attack softens transients and has the effect of pushing an element back.[^6]

Release is how long it takes to return to unity. Release times can effect the sustain. A too-fast release may have a weird ducking sound to it.[^6]

Alex Tumay says attack and release is much more important than how much gain reduction you're getting.[^7]

With max ratio, fast release, and a deep threshold, adjust the attack to your liking. After you've found the right attack setting, do the same for the release.[^8]
