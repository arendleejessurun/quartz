# Using reverbs to create depth
As a sound moves farther away, its direct level decreases while its reverberated level remains about the same. Sound loses 6dB per doubling of distance.[^1]

Early reflections of a reverb can situate a sound in a place.[^2] These early reflections also help each track of a mix blend.[^3] This makes sense to me because it smears the transient.

Pre-delay can situate a sound in a place too (see [[Using delay to create depth]]). Use this to create a sense of the instrument's location. Reverbs with no pre-delay give the impression that the source signal is further away. Reverbs with pre-delay bring the source signal closer. Start off with 10 to 20 milliseconds of pre-delay.[^4]

Distant sounds tend to reflect off of more surfaces.[^5] Use late reflections to exploit this.

[[ValhallaVintageVerb]] has controls for early and late reflections. So does Phoenix Verb.

Consider also [[Using EQ to create depth]] on the reverb aux.

I like to use two reverbs on a source sometimes, like a plate and a chamber. One reverb can be used for character, the other for placement via early and late reflections.[^6]
