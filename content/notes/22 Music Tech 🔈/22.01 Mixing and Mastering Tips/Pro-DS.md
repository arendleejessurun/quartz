# Pro-DS

## CPU
0.1-0.2% depending on OS

## Tips and tricks
Use it as a high-frequency limiter in Allround mode and split band processing. This can be useful for mastering. [^1]

Darrell Thorp uses it with a broad frequency range, from 4k-14kHz.[^2]

## Oversampling IR

## Sine sweep test at -18, spectrograph readings at -130dB, OS on
Doesn't seem to add any harmonics.

## Harmonic analysis at 5k
2x OS reduces some of the "aura" around the tone.
