# GSatPlus

## Tips and tricks
The saturation is "tube-based."[^1]

Has the ability to change channel modes natively, which could be useful for tolerance emulation stuff.

2x oversampling is enough for all modes, except Crisp. 

Fluctuation adds mid and side harmonics.[^2]

## CPU
~0.2% at 2x, comparable to [[Lindell 80]].

## Oversampling IR
4x

## Hammerstein test

### Clean
Has a little bump around 5k.

Odd harmonics, 2 stages

Even harmonics, 2 stages

### Warm
Dip at 10k, which could be useful for [[Controlling harsh high end]].

### Crisp
Like Warm, it has a 10k dip, but with higher harmonics.
