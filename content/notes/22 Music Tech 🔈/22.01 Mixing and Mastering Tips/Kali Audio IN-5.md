# Kali Audio IN-5
They're three-way, which is good against comb-filtering in the midrange.

Bandwidth is 39-25kHz (-10 dB).[^1]

[[Testing speakers' low frequency response]]

Resonances (with no LF trim)
- 47Hz (F#)
- 98Hz (G) is ~2dB louder than 105Hz (G#)

The port is tuned to 43Hz, which coincides with a low E on a bass.[^2]

On-axis (blue) and off-axis (green) isn't terribly different, thanks to the concentric drivers.[^2]
