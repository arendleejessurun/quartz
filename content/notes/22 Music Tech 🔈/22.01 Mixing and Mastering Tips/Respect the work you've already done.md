# Respect the work you've already done
Shelly Yakus advises to respect the work you've done. Once you've got a working mix, trust the choices you have made and resist the urge to go back and tinker. The reason being, mixing is an interdependent process. Going back to tinker may throw off the balance. Gregory Scott likens this to pulling a strand of thread from a sweater. There are many ways forward in a mix and not one right answer.[^1]

I've gotten into this rut before. I notice a problem and then try to address it at its source. Or I learn a new, better way to EQ, and then I redo all my EQ.
