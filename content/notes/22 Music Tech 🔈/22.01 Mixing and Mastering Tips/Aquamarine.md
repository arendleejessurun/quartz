## Mix 1 notes
Very solid first mix to be hyped on. 

In terms of notes, I’d like to increase the volume and clarity with all of the vocals, including the screams, which are getting lost in the mix. I’d also like to bring down the bass a bit and create more clarity to some of the syncopation throughout the track, especially for the breakdown/chugging sections — I think my initial thoughts and notes might have made the first pass a bit bottom-heavy and muddy.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there’s anything you want to try!

## Mix 2 notes
Thanks for the quick turnaround! Notes below:

- Let's make the bass drum more present and punchy to reinforce the syncopation throughout the song. Some of those lower tom-tom hits can also be more present, like on 0:25 right before the chorus ("i want you to be there THROUGH it all")
- We can pump up the gang vocals a bit more (i.e. "so let me know")
- During my chorus, could you pitch up my "that" in the line ("a splash of sunshine in THAT aquamarine")? I'm pushing it flat when it should be the same note as "the" in "i swear these colors are THE brightest I've seen"

Those are the only notes I have at the moment. I also want to pass this over to Michael to get some of his feedback and balance recommendations.

Thanks for your patience here. Including Michael's notes below. I've also CCed him in case there's anything you want to chat about more directly, as my acumen and tech-speak pales in comparison to both of you.

- _More snap in the kick, to match what's in the snare, it'll help sections like that pre-chorus 2 really land_
- _Vocals feel a little hot, and I think if I were mixing, I'd explore the stereo imagery for all vox overall. In the bridge particularly they're pretty stacked in the center channel_
	- I admittedly might have been mishearing with my initial note to turn up the vox, based on what I was using to review mix1

- [x] Balance
	- [x] More low tom hits, like at 0:25
	- [x] More gang vox "so let me know"
	- [x] Lower vox
	- [x] Lower the lead vocal by about 1.5db across the board.

	- [x] In Matt's chorus, pitch up my "that" in the line "a splash of sunshine in THAT aquamarine"
- [x] Enhance
	- [x] Punchier, snappier kick drum, it'll help sections like that pre-chorus 2 really land
	- [x] Give all guitars a wide-boost between about 160hz-800hz of about 2.5-3.5db
	- [x] The snare could also use a subtle narrow boost around 200hz, maybe 1-1.5db, so we get a bit more thud
