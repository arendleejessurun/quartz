# How to use a high-pass filter
Find the lowest fundamental, go an octave below that, and place a high-pass filter at 24dB/octave (or steeper).[^1]

Another technique is [[High pass dramatically, then bring it down]].

Engineers have been high-passing since the beginning, especially because recording to tape produced a lot of low-end build-up.[^2] [[Have no fear about high-pass filtering]].

Beware of filtering on multi-mic material. For multi-mic sources, high-pass at the bus, so you don't lose phase correlation.[^3] Parallel HPF will produce a deep notch at the corner frequency.[^4]
