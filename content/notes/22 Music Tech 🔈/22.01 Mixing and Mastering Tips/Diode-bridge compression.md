# Diode-bridge compression
Diode-bridge, or diode-ring, compressors provide compression faster than [[Optical compression]] with less distortion that [[FET compression]].[^1] Diode-bridge compression, like Neve's 2254 and 33609, can be useful for addressing thinness or abrasiveness.[^2] The EMI TG12413, of Abbey Road and Dark Side Of The Moon fame,[^2] and the Neve 535 and 5254 are popular diode-based compressors.[^3] [[Lindell 80]] does a Neve 2245 compressor. [[MTurboComp]] has a Neve mode.

Joe Barresi likes the EMI for its fast attack on drums, and Joe Chiccarelli likes the EMI's warm, vintage sound. Michael Brauer and Nick Launay like the grit that comes from an EMI when they push drums into it.[^2]
