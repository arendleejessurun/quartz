# Reverb pre-delay
Pre-delay can make the reverb sound far away and the dry source close. This can get depth on a vocal.[^1] You can calculate pre-delay according to BPM with an equation or with [this website](https://www.tuneform.com/tools/time-tempo-bpm-to-milliseconds-ms).

Marc Daniel Nelson uses 70, 120, and 200ms. He also automates pre-delays to heighten the scene.[^1]

By sending instrument groups to different pre-delays and returning to one room reverb, you can create a soundstage. Warren Huart uses longer pre-delays for farther away sounds, as if they were arriving to a room mic at different times.[^2]
