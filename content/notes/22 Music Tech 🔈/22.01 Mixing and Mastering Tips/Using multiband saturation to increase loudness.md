# Using multiband saturation to increase loudness
Use a multiband saturator/exciter to generate more frequencies. If the high mids are lacking, saturate the low mids. You can also do the same to increase energy in the highs, which typically lack energy.^[ [How To Make A Mix SOUND Louderâ€¦ Without Increasing Level!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmzZhAQyBtA)]

The upper midrange frequencies are where our ears are most-attuned. Anything well-balanced in this way will sound louder.^[ [Why your mixes sound thin and weak (probably)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2P_Opp4a6iY)]

I use [[Saturn 2]] for this purpose.
