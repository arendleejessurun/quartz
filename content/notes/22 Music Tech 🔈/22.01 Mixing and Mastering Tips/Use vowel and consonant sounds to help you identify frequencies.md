# Use vowel and consonant sounds to help you identify frequencies
I came upon this concept from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY9cJh7PyOQ). I've combined it with what I understand of the International Phonetic Alphabet.[^1]

Jason Corey says u, o, a, e, and i correspond to octave frequencies 250Hz, 500Hz, 1000Hz, etc.[^2] I've built on and refined this concept for my own use. 

| Frequency | Phoneme                                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 250Hz     | u                                                       |
| 315Hz     | two parts u, one part o (kinda like ʊ, as in "hook")    |
| 400Hz     | inverse                                                 |
| 500Hz     | o, as in RP "yawn"                                      |
| 630Hz     | two parts o, one part a (kinda like ɔ, as in "thought") |
| 800Hz     | inverse (kinda like ɑ, as in "hot")                     |
| 1kHz      | a (as in California "hat")                              |
| 1.25kHz   | two parts a, one part ɛ (kinda like æ, as in "cat")     |
| 1.6kHz    | inverse                                                 |
| 2kHz      | ɛ, as in "bed"                                          |
| 2.5kHz    | two parts ɛ, one part i (kinda like e, as in "may")     |
| 3.15kHz   | inverse (kinda like ɪ, as in "bit")                     |
| 4kHz      | i, as in "free"                                         |
| 5kHz      | two parts i, one part s                                 |
| 6.3kHz    | inverse                                                 |
| 8kHz      | s                                                       |
| 10kHz     | two parts s, one part ts                                |
| 12.5kHz   | inverse                                                 |
| 16kHz     | ts                                                      |

Interestingly, words like "boomy" and "tinny", common words among audio engineers for describing sound, seem to correspond really well to this chart.
