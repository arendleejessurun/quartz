# Vocal reverb
[[Plate reverb]], [[Chamber reverb]], and [[Hall reverb]] all sound good for vocals.

To keep some separation on the vocal, sidechain compress the reverb keying from the dry vocal. This can make vocals sound huge and deep.[^1]

[[Use delay and reverb in series for big sounds]].

[[Use a dark vocal space for glue]].

Andy Wallace uses a [[Vocal delay]] on one side and sends that to a reverb on the other side.[^2] This has a cool stadium kinda sound.

Another cool trick is to have a shorter reverb on the sides and a longer reverb or [[Vocal delay]] in the center.[^3]
