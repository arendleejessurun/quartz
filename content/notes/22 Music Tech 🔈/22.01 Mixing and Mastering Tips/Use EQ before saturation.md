# Use EQ before saturation
Tame low-end before saturation to get smoother saturation.

The amplitude of low-frequency content is often higher than that of high frequency content. This is apparent because of the overtone series.

It can also be explained because the energy of a sine wave depends on its amplitude and its frequency.[^1]

> *E ~ Af*

To keep a constant energy, for frequency to increase, amplitude must decrease.[^1]

This can be used for other overpowering frequencies too.

Boosting before saturation can be used to exploit the [[Missing fundamental]] phenomenon.[^1] I can also do this with Saturn, SlickEQ, Spectre, or any saturation that allows me to use it on a specific band.
