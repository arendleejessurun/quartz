# Reverb can used to change the tone
In much the same way that [[Reverb can be used to create blend]], start with a short reverb, but this time go with an unnatural-sounding reverb like a plate, spring, or nonlinear reverb. These tend to work best for single sources, just as when [[Reverb can be used to add sustain]].[^1]

The reverb can then be sculpted with an EQ. Don't be afraid to try out several different EQ plugins. The tone can also be effected by changing the pre-delay and listening for desirable comb-filtering.[^2] The same concept can be done with short delays to add comb-filtering.[^3]

Just adding a room reverb to the instruments can do a lot to mix things together before doing any EQ or compression.[^4]
