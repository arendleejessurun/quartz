# Invert the polarity of one track before saturation
Invert the polarity of one of the stereo tracks before saturation and then invert it back after so it sums to mono well.[^1] Vlad G speaks to the same in the comments of this [Dan Worrall video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD6_Bajj2DI). Use [[JS Channel Polarity Control]] to flip the polarity. I think [[JS Channel Router]] does the same too.

This would be cool to try on [[Mixing electric guitar|Electric guitar]].
