# Crafting transitions
Ride fills for transitions, particularly drums. Consider just riding the overheads. Maybe push the volume into a compressor for more density.[^1]

Push bass up just a decibel. People don't often hear that kind of change, but they will feel it.[^1]

Use a boom sound effect on a downbeat to mark a transition.[^2] I can use the [[Reaper media explorer]] for help with this.

For more, see [[How to use noise samples]].
