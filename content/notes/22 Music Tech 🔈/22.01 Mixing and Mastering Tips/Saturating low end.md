# Saturating low end
Saturating low end can give the psychoacoustic impression that the bass fundamental is loud, as demonstrated by the [[Missing fundamental]] effect. Sidechaining the bass fundamental keyed from the kick can be helpful to control the sub bass while keeping bass consistent (see [[Sidechaining kick and bass]]).[^1]

Using emphasis and de-emphasis EQ with a saturator between can be useful so you can get more saturation before the bass frequencies get so crushed (see [[Use EQ before saturation]]).[^1]

Parallel distortion can also be useful.[^1] Waves' RBass saturates just the low frequencies around the corner frequency. You can do something similar by adding a parallel LPF with some resonance, a saturator, and end it with a HPF to isolate those harmonics.[^2]
