# Using multiband dynamics to increase loudness
In a similar way as [[Using EQ to increase loudness]], use a multiband expander to make the region louder whenever its volume falls below a certain threshold.^[ [How To Make A Mix SOUND Louderâ€¦ Without Increasing Level!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmzZhAQyBtA)] A multiband compressor can address the same problem, in a different way, by compressing regions with too much energy.

I use [[Nova GE]] for this purpose.
