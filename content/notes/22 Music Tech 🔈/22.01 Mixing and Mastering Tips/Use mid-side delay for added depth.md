# Use mid-side delay for added depth
0.1-0.3ms of delay on the mid channel makes enough of a different. 0.02ms makes hardly any difference when listening in stereo, but helps with binaural translation.[^1]

Phase shifting on the mid channel does a similar kind of thing, like the phi function does in [[SlickEQ GE]].[^1] I'd like to try this with [[Volcano 3]] too.[^2]

For yet another flavor, using an all-pass filter to rotate the phase on the mid channel.[^1]
