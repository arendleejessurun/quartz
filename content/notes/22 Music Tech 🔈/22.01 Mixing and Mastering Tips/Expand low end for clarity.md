# Expand low end for clarity
Sometimes a kick drum can rumble on too long in the low end, causing rhythmic problems. Use a multiband expander on this frequency region to alleviate the problem. Matthew Weiss does this with an 808 style kick that is too rumble.[^1] A simple gate on the kick can work wonders too.[^2] [[Nova GE]] does this. This may also be useful for [[Managing resonances on bass]] and guitar.

Warren Huart uses a transient designer to achieve similar results.[^3]
