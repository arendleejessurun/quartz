# How to mask time edits
Use these techniques to mask timing edits to a waveform:^[ [[Mixing Secrets for the Small Studio]] pg. 105-106]
- Short crossfade lengths (5ms). 
- Edit point in silence. 
- Edit point in noise. 
- Edit point just before transient (called backward temporal masking or premasking). Try 5ms.
- Edit point where another instrument, like drums, can mask it. 
- Matched-waveform edit for vocals, bass, and leads.
	- Mike Senior uses these edits on dull vowel sounds.
