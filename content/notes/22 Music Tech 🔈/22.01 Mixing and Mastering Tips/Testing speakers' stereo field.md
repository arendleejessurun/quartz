# Testing speakers' stereo field
Use this StereoTest to check for phase and polarity issues. "This file contains a repeating pattern of four noise bursts: the first only in the left channel; the second only in the right channel; the third in both channels; and the fourth in both channels, but with the right channel out of polarity with the left channel. You can use this file to confirm correct stereo speaker setup and assess the stability of your phantom image."^[ [Chapter 1: Nearfield Monitors](https://cambridge-mt.com/ms/ch1/)]

If the bursts are out of phase, then adjust the speakers and/or listening position so the sound for each speaker reaches you at the same time. If the bursts are out of polarity, check wiring.^[ [[Mixing Secrets for the Small Studio]] pg. 17]
