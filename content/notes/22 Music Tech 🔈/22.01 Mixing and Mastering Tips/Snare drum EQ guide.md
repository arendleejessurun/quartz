# Snare drum EQ guide
The fundamental typically sits between 150-250.[^1]

The smack is around 900-1.4kHz.[^3]

Sometimes the snare body, or fundamental, can be a little over-represented.[^1]

Warren Huart uses a low shelving boost at 100 to bring in more body.[^2]

Boosting the snare high-mids and mids gives a little more smack to it.[^1]

The snare bottom mic captures more of the sizzle of the snares on the bottom drum head.[^1] Boost the highs around 7k to bring out the snare wires and help it cut through the mix.[^3] I notice I tend to like snares with some 6-7kHz presence.
