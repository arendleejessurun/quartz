# Mixing background vocals
For [[How to treat sibilants]] on BGVs, sidechain the lead vocal esses on the BGV bus. Marc Daniel Nelson uses a multiband compressor for this with a corner frequency at about 4kHz. This keeps the BGVs present but tucked back.[^1]

Consider cutting some of the important vocal clarity frequencies from the mid channel with [[Mid-side processing]].[^2]
