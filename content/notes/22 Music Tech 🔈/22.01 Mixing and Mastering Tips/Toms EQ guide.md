# Toms EQ guide
It's easy for toms to get buried, so consider boosting the attack in the mid-highs/highs.[^1]

Cut out any resonant frequencies that obfuscate the fundamental.[^1]

As with [[Kick drum EQ guide|kick]] and [[Snare drum EQ guide|snare]], make sure the fundamental is present.[^1]

There may be a hollow low-mid range sound between 500-700Hz that will mask other instruments.[^1] Cut this for clarity.[^2]
