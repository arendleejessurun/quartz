# Making the snare more present

## Instrument bus method
As demonstrated in this JST video.[^1]
1. Boost the snare fader until you feel its impact.
2. Place a compressor or limiter on the instrument bus to control peaks.
3. Use a clipper and/or reverb on the snare channel to get more body.

## Bypass bus method
Send the snare straight to the master bus or to a separate bypass bus.[^2] You can also use this for anything that needs to be louder.
