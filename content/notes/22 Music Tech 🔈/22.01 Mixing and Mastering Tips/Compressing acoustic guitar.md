# Compressing acoustic guitar
Use [[FET compression]] or [[Optical compression]]. CLA uses an LA3A (which is solid state, not tube, and quicker than an LA2A).[^1]

Ed Cherney (Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, Sting, Bonnie Raitt) says, "the 1176 was made for acoustic guitars."[^2]

Warren Huart recommends using parallel compression on a fingerpicked guitar part, crushing it with a FET.[^3]

Marc Daniel Nelson uses [[MJUC]] MkII with a 4:1 ratio and a medium-slow attack and fast release, only compressing about .5dB.[^4]

I really like using [[Presswerk]] on acoustic guitar, using a topology similar to a dbx160.

A limiter after light compression can help tame peaks.[^6] For more, see [[Softening digital transients]].

Adding a little tube saturation can help thicken up acoustic guitars too.[^5]
