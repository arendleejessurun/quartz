# Use a limiter on the low-end
Dynamics are not as perceivable in the low-end. Bass guitar dynamics, for instance, come from the attack, which is midrange.[^1] This can help keep the low-end consistent. If you've got a DI track, [[Use the fundamental from the bass DI]].

I can use this in combination with [[Managing resonances on bass]] and [[Creating a multiband linear phase crossover]].

Use the dry/wet knob to get more dynamics back in.
