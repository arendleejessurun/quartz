# Use fader balance to reduce EQ labor later
Instead of over-EQing, try to get the frequency balance of the mix right at the level balancing stage.

For multi-mic instruments, play with the balance between mics to shape tone. (For another take on this, use samples.) For single-mic instruments, use the [[Fletcher-Munson curve]] to your advantage by boosting or cutting the overall level to affect how we perceive the tone.[^1]

Later I can use subtractive EQ for corrective and unmasking purposes, and then [[Use a single bus EQ for high freq boost]].
