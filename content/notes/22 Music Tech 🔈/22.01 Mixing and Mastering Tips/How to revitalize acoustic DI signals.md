# How to revitalize acoustic DI signals
If you have an accompanying mic signal of the instrument, use a plugin to match the EQ of the DI to the mic.

If you don't have a mic signal, try using convolution reverb. Mute the dry signal, select a small room ambience present, then use the envelope controls to shorten the reverb tail to a few tens of milliseconds.[^1]
