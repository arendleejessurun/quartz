# How to create depth in a mix
Creating depth is all about contrast. These techniques are useful only when they are used to highlight contrasts.

A useful tool may be drawing out the soundstage on a piece of paper first.[^2]

- [[Using EQ to create depth]]
- [[Shaping transients to create depth]]
- [[Using saturation to add presence]]
- [[Treating problematic stereo sounds in a mix]]
- [[Using reverbs to create depth]]
- [[Using delay to create depth]]
- [[Pitch-shifting to create depth]]
- [[Use a holographic sound on the mixbus]]

All these can be automated to help things move around the soundstage.

Elements that are less important don't need to be fiddled with much. Having them remain dull-sounding can be useful for contrast.[^1]
