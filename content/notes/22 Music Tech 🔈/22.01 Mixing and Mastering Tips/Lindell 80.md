# Lindell 80

## Tips and tricks
OS introduces some pre-ringing.

The preamp sounds warm, a little "congested" at worst. Balancing this with some of its EQ can help.

The impulse is slower than [[Lindell 50]] in the lows.

2x oversampling works for up to 20dB of preamp gain. Anything more could use 4x or more.

## Sine sweep test at -18, spectrograph readings at -130dB, OS on
Just the preamp, cranked up 20dB

With no OS, I can get 3dB
