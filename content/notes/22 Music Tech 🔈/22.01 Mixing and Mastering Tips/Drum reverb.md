# Drum reverb
CLA doesn't send kick or snare to reverb. He instead sends rooms, samples, snare bottom, and toms to the reverb. This lets the transients of the kick and snare come through.[^1]

Marc Daniel Nelson similarly likes to have the attack from the kick and snare close mics intact.[^2]

[[Plate reverb]] is useful for drums due to its quick onset.
