# All about phase and polarity
Phase is a function of time. Polarity is a function of positive and negative. Shifting phase for a signal of multiple frequencies will affect each of those frequencies differently, versus flipping polarity for a signal of multiple frequencies, which will cause all of them to cancel.[^1]

A sine wave is like a circle being unwrapped over time. We measure its positive and negative values in degrees. Phase is proportional to time. Frequency is how fast the phase is changing.[^2]
