# Use short delays for stereo width
Create a short delay and hard pan it opposite the dry signal. Delays of 20ms or less tend to create comb filtering, which can produce a similar effect as [[Use a graphic EQ for stereo widening|graphic EQ for stereo width]]. (I wonder if [[MPhaser]] can do this.) Follow this with a high-pass to reduce the phase cancellation. Dan Worrall demonstrates this in a YouTube video.

You can also use Haas delay of ~30ms. Shorted delays tend to produce more phase cancellation.[^1] Listen in mono, [[Creating a Haas effect]], and maybe follow it with a phase correction plug-in.
