# Use reference tracks and reference monitors
Psychophysicists tell us our sensations are influenced by change. We tend to ignore consistent stimuli, like the hum of a refrigerator. As engineers, it's important to switch listening systems regularly and compare with reference tracks.[^1] Dan Worrall likens these to palate cleansers.[^2] Reference tracks and reference monitors are like the carbonated water served with espresso.

Consider shuffling reference tracks around so you're not always comparing 1:49 of your mix with 1:49 of the reference.[^3] This can help offer different perspectives and refresh the ears.

Visit Bob Katz's [Honor Roll](https://www.digido.com/honor-roll/?utm_source=pocket_mylist) to find some albums with great dynamics ranges. See [[Recommended reference tracks]]. See also [[Mixing engineers I admire]].

I remember learning from Gabe that our sense of temperature is by conductivity.
