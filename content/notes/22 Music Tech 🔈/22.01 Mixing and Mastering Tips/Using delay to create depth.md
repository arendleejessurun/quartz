# Using delay to create depth
[[Sync the delay to the tempo for a less-noticeable effect]] and thus, a more "forward" sound.

Consider also [[Using EQ to create depth]] on the delay aux. Analog-style delays also tend to lose high end with each repeat.[^1]

Delay is less diffuse than reverb, making it potentially work better for lead instruments and vocals.[^1]

Check distance-to-time-delay measurements [here](http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-soundpath.htm).

[[Use mid-side delay for added depth]].
