# FET compression
FET (field effect transistor) compressors have a quick attack, often used to catch transients.[^1] They are based off of transistors, which were used to emulate tubes. FET compression can have an aggressive tone when pushed.[^2] They can also be used as a colorful preamp with the compression turned off.[^3] The 1176 is the most famous FET compressor.[^4]

FET compression may be likened to a chisel.[^5] [[DC8C3]] can do compression similar to FET-style with Crush mode. [[MTurboComp]] does an 1176. [[MJUC]] Mk2 does a 176, the all-tube predecessor of the 1176, somewhere between tube and FET. It seems [[Pro-C 2]]'s Punch mode is FET-inspired. Reaper's [[1175 Compressor]] is based on an 1176.

Rick Beato likes 1176s on snare, acoustic guitar, piano, and vocals.[^6] Chris Lordâ€‘Alge, Michael Brauer, and Rich Costey like an 1176 on drums, especially for their harmonic coloration. Steve Churchyard, Chris Lordâ€‘Alge, and Ralph Sutton like an 1176 on bass too, though be careful not to have a too-fast attack time that it distorts on bass waveforms.[^7]
