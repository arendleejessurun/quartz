# Analog summing
Analog summing causes the following effects:
- Some noise and interference (which I'm not so interested in).
- Different tolerances between channels and crosstalk.
- Nonlinear output stages on individual channels.
- Nonlinear output stages on summed channels.
- And maybe interaction between channels.[^1]

Without individual channel nonlinearities and such, analog summing won't make a mix sound like it was recorded through a desk. There's much more to a desk than just analog summing. So having analog emulation at the individual channel level is important too.[^1]

A little bus saturation results in the warmth, clarity, and glue of classic analog recordings.[^2]

The actual "summing" part of analog summing is perhaps not any different than digital summing.[^3]

So it would seem all you need to do on busses to get the analog summing sound is just play with tolerance, crosstalk, and saturation.
