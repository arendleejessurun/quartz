# Recording acoustic guitar
Start with the mic at the 12th fret, 12 to 16 inches from the instrument.

Ross Hogarth (Van Halen, Keb' Mo', Ziggy Marley, John Mellencamp) uses small diaphragms for acoustic guitars that are focal, pointing them at the 12th or 15th fret.[^2]

Richard Chycki (Rush, Dream Theater, Aerosmith, Alice Cooper, Skillet) uses a small diaphragm a foot away angled slightly toward the headstock.[^2]

For classical or picking parts, Ed Cherney sometimes uses a large diaphragm in conjunction with a small-diaphragm. He even sometimes uses an SM57 when tracking a band live.[^2]
