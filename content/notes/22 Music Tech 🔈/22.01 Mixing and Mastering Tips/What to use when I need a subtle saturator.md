# What to use when I need a subtle saturator
[[Volcano 3]]'s Smooth sounds nice for [[Mixing vocals]]. Hollow has a nice depth that tucks things back. With low drive settings, I don't need oversampling at all.

[[SlickEQ GE]] has great saturation. I like Deep for the depth and dimension it gives. Excited is good for adding presence without losing warmth. Funky shifts energy from the low mids to the high midsâ€”great on uke. Seven sounds great for [[Mixing electric guitar]] because of the way it saturates the transients.

[[Saturn 2]] has a low CPU usage and can do tape, tube, and transformer. Best of all, in the subtle modes, I don't have to use oversampling. Subtle Tube and Subtle Tape are my favorites for [[Mixing vocals]], Subtle Tape being a little a little brighter. Subtle Transformer is too harsh.

[[GSatPlus]] has a low CPU usage. If I just need a little extra something-something, this is a good choice. Warm mode has a dip at 10k, which could be useful for [[Controlling harsh high end]].

My go-to compressor [[DC8C3]] also has saturation built in.
