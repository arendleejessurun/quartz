# Using EQ to increase loudness
Using a spectrum analyzer, find which frequencies are lacking energy, paying special attention to high mids. Use an EQ to balance energy accordingly.[^1] The idea is to have the spectrum more closely resemble pink noise or an [[Fletcher-Munson curve|Equal loudness curve]] (depending on taste).

Additive EQ can have the side-effect of boosting peaks in that region, so subtractive EQ may be a better option.[^2] Moreover, cutting early in the chain can prevent from nonlinearities reacting too much to a particular frequency range. [[Use EQ before saturation]].

Alternatively, try [[Using multiband dynamics to increase loudness]].
