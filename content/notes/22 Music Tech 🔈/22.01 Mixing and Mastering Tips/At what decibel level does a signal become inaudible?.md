# At what decibel level does a signal become inaudible?
The human hearing range is 0dB to 130dB. In exceptional cases, humans can hear down to -15dB. 130dB is the pain threshold for humans.[^1] For perspective, a whisper from 6 feet away is ~30dB. A normal conversation from 3 feet away is ~60-65dB. Sustained exposure to 90-95dB levels may cause hearing loss.[^2]

This stands to reason, that even if a person is listening to music with speakers cranked to the pain threshold of 130dB, then signals lower than -130dB, or in exceptional cases, -145dB, are imperceptible. This means a signal at -130dB is virtually a mute.
