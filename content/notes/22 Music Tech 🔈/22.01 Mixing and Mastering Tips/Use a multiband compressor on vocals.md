# Use a multiband compressor on vocals
Create separate bands for sibilance and the singer's different vocal ranges. Only cut a few dB, with fastest attack and release.[^1] I might try this for different vowel formants too. Marc Daniel Nelson uses [[Pro-Q 3]] in dynamic mode.[^2] Use fast releases on the high bands so you don't get a pumping sound.[^3]
