# Testing speakers' low frequency response
Use the LFSineTones file [here](https://cambridge-mt.com/ms/ch1/) to test for resonances in your monitoring setup. These resonances may come from the speaker itself (especially if it has a port) or from its mounting setup. Listen for any furniture humming along. Place a finger on your mounting hardware to feel if there are any obvious vibrations.[^1] This chart, copied from page 25, shows which frequencies happen at which timestamps.

Ported speakers often have bass resonances by virtue of their port.[^2] I think of guitar sound holes as a way of relating this. More about ports [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093825/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct00/articles/monitor.htm).
