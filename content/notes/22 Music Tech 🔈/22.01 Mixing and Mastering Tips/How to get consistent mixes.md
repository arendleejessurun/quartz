# How to get consistent mixes
Everyone can mix, but not everyone can do it consistently.

The biggest way get consistent results is to practice. Remember it's okay to not mail every mix. Practice mixing different types of music.

Ed Cherney says to take your time to mix a song, take some time away, mix it again, then analyze both mixes. It's not about making two mixes sound the same, but whether both are great.

Be aware of the things you do, what your style is.[^1] [[Having a voice is essential for a sustainable career]].
