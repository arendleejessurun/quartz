# Use a single bus EQ for high freq boost
Instead of doing EQ boosts across multiple tracks, use a single high CPU EQ on the bus. The high CPU EQ will likely handle high frequencies better, without it getting brittle.[^1] A Pultec was made for this.[^2]

Passive EQ is subtle, making it useful for the mixbus. You can crank them without them really being apparent. Marc Daniel Nelson sets and forgets his Pultec clone boosting 60Hz at 2 on the dial and 10kHz at 5 on the dials.[^3]
