# Blending a mix
Send the tracks that need blend into the same reverb (see [[Using reverbs to create depth]] and [[Reverb can be used to create blend]]). [[Using delay to create blend or size]].

Background noise can also help blend. Try using room tone, tape hiss, or vinyl noise.[^1] To go deeper with creative noise, see [[How to use noise samples]].
