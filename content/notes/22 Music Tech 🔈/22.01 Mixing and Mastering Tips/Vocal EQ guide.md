# Vocal EQ guide
A little goes a long way when cutting low-mids on vocals. It's easy to rob the vocal of its warmth.[^1]

The first harmonic is where the warmth and body lies (e.g. if the fundamental is 100Hz, 200Hz is the first harmonic).[^2] Cutting here before [[Compressing vocals]] can improve clarity.[^3]

Boost 300Hz if your vocal feels hollow or nasal.[^4]

300-500Hz can sound boxy and have room resonance.[^2]

400-500Hz is typically a muddy region.[^4] 500-1kHz is a region where rooms tend to resonate.[^5] 550-600Hz can be a trouble spot for female vocals.[^6]

600Hz is another warmth spot, but it can sound boxy too.[^2] I like to bring this out in a [[Vocal reverb]].

2k-5kHz is an area of vocal intelligibility.[^4] 

1k-2.5kHz is good for presence, but it can sound honky and nasally.[^2] I noticed down to 900Hz sometimes too. Billy Decker actually uses a de-esser on this zone. I can try a dynamic EQ.[^8]

2.5k-3.5kHz is nasally at worst but present at best.[^2]

Our ears are most attuned to 4kHz. This range can get harsh.[^2]

You can [[Use a parallel high band to add intelligibility]]. Boosting the delays and reverbs can also add intelligibility. Gregory Scott argues this is because of our evolutionary propensity to cue in to sound reflections.[^7]

6kHz is for clarity, but it can get tinny.[^2] This is often where constants lie.

7k-10kHz is sibilant.[^2]

Boost 8kHz with a bell or shelf for sheen.[^4]

10k-16kHz is where the top end sizzle is.[^2]

Boost 12-14kHz with a shelf. You may like to follow this with a cut at 18kHz.[^4]

20kHz is the air.[^2]

[[Use a multiband compressor on vocals]]. Joseph sets this at a threshold where it only activates at louder moments.[^6]
