# Mixing maxims
If I can't get it in three takes, I'll have to practice more.

If I spend more than 5 minutes trying equalize a track, EQ is probably not the whole solution.

Once I've tasted the sushi on its own, then I use soy sauce if I'd like. Which is to say, listen first and use only what you need. EQ for a reason, compress for a reason, and avoid doing anything automatically.

Always prefer simple processing like fader level before more complicated processing like multiband dynamics. [[Always prefer the plain direct word â€”C.S. Lewis]]. [[Use fader balance to reduce EQ labor later]].

If you're going back and forth about small changes, you're probably done.[^1]
