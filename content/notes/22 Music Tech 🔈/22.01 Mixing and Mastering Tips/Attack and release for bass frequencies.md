# Attack and release for bass frequencies
1Hz is 1 oscillation per second.

One calculation is `(1/n*10)/2 = x seconds` where n = lowest fundamental frequency.[^1]

Another calculation is `1/n*1000 = x ms`.[^2]

Longer attack times of several tens to hundreds of milliseconds may have an effect like a low-shelving boost.[^3]
