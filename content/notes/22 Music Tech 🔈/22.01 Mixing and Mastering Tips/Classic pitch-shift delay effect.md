# Classic pitch-shift delay effect
Use different short delay times for the left and right channels as well as different pitch shift values. Mike Senior uses a slightly longer delay on the sharp pitch-shifted channel to counteract the [[Precedence Effect]]. 

Left channel: 14ms delay, -7 cents.
Right channel: 17ms delay, +7 cents.[^1]

Warren Huart does several of these, alternating which side is sharp or flat.[^2]

This works well on vocals.

You can also even widen this, which is something I've seen Tom Lord-Alge do.[^3]

Lastly, check in mono and use correlometer, as in [[Creating a Haas effect]].
