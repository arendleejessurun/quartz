# Use multiband compression to control low end
Phil Allen uses a four-band compressor to address "hot" and "cold" spots (see [[Managing resonances on bass]]). He limits the high-end on pick bass.[^1]

Wytse uses a fast attack and release time with lookahead.[^2]

Multiband low-end compression can be useful for buses too. Dan Worrall uses a gentle ratio of 1.5:1 and digs down deep.[^3]
