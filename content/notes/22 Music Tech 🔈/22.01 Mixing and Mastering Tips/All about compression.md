# All about compression
Compression is a [[Nonlinear process]].

It is composed of two processes: gain reduction on the highest levels followed by a linear output gain called makeup gain.[^1]

I like to set up compressors as follows: get an idea of what kind of attack and release I want, dial in a threshold, then adjust ratio to taste.
