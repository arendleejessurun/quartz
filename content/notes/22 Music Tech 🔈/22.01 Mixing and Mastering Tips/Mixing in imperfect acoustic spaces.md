# Mixing in imperfect acoustic spaces
The biggest danger is poor mix translation in the bass frequencies. [[Use a big block size on a frequency analyzer to check bass]] to and use your metering to check you're in the ballpark. This can also be helpful when [[Managing resonances on bass]].

Check the mix on a variety of systems. I have my nearfields, my MixCube, and my headphones. I can also do a car test and an earbud test. In the future, it may also be worth buying some cheap grotboxes too.
