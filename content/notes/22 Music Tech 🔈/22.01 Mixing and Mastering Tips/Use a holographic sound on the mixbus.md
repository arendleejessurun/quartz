# Use a holographic sound on the mixbus
Analog emulations often have a "holographic" quality to them. By holographic, the sound is sitting somewhere in the side-to-side and front-to-back field.[^1] I believe this is due to phase differences and crossfeed.

Marc Daniel Nelson uses compressors and such on the mixbus without actually compressing anything. The trick is to keep it extremely subtle.[^2] He even has several different emulations of the same hardware because they each sound a little different.[^1]

Marc tries to make things sound as big as he can.[^3]
