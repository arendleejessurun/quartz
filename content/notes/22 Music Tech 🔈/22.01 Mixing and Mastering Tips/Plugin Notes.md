# Plugin Notes
- [[Can't-work-without plugins]]
- [[Recommended free plugins]]

## EQ
- [[Pro-Q 3]]
- [[Volcano 3]]
- [[SlickEQ GE]] (moderately CPU heavy)
- [[SlickEQ M]] (CPU intensive)
- [[Nova GE]] (great for pink noise matching to get a quick tonal balance)
- [[TEOTE]] (good OS, kinda steep anti-aliasing filter)
- [[DSEQ3]] (great OS, great anti-aliasing filter)
- [[RS-W2395c]]
- [[ReaEQ]]
- [[Lindell 80]]
- [[Lindell 50]]

## Compressor
- [[DC8C3]] (I like this a lot as a track comp, very tweakable, does fast, character compression nicely, with a good balance of even with some odd harmonics, CPU light)
- [[MJUC]] (really great for subtle compression with character, lots of even harmonics, CPU moderate)
- [[Pro-C 2]] (great OS, good anti-aliasing filter, easiest, most comprehensive comp to use, CPU light)
- [[Presswerk]]
- [[Molot GE]] (I like this a lot as a track comp, mostly odd harmonics, with some even, CPU intensive)
- [[TB Compressor 4]] (Clean mode could be good for vocal air)
- [[Kotelnikov GE]] (transparent, with a bit of harmonics, nice for buses, CPU intensive though)
- [[DC1A]] (easy two-knob, kinda like a chill FET-style, would probably be good on vocals)
- [[Saturn 2]]
- [[ReaComp]] (really low CPU usage)

## Other dynamics
- [[Limiter 6]] (great clipper)
- [[Pro-DS]] (good OS, good anti-aliasing filter)
- [[Sibalance v4]] (CPU light)
- [[Nova GE]] (great for multi-band comp, upwards comp, limiting)
- [[StandardCLIP]]
- [[StandardGATE]]
- [[Transient Designer Plus]]
- [[Slew3]] (incredibly CPU light)
- [[entropy EQ+]]
- [[TB MBC]]
- [[ReaLimit]] (really low CPU usage, but a little too bright)
- [[MAutoVolume]] (tad bit smeary at Nyquist, I'd like to test its nonlinearities)
- [[RX 9 De-ess]]
- T-De-Esser

## Saturation
- [[Saturn 2]] (CPU light)
- [[SDRR2]] (CPU moderate)
- [[Channel9]] (very CPU light)
- [[Wow Control]]

- [[Volcano 3]]
- [[StandardCLIP]]
- [[Spiral2]]
- [[AnalogStage MK2]]
- [[GSatPlus]] (could be useful as a preamp emulator)
- [[Chow Tape Model]] (has great functionality for tape dropouts, CPU light)
