# Controlling harsh high end
Balance a cut with a boost, e.g. a cut at 5kHz and a boost at 15kHz.[^1] You can also use a simple low-pass filter to emulate the lower bandwidth of analog gear.[^2]

For vocals, use a multiband compressor or spectral shaper on the harsh zone ([[Nova GE]], [[TB MBC]], or [[DSEQ3]]).[^3] Follow that up with a de-esser (Darrell Thorp uses [[Pro-DS]]) and then boost with a shelf.[^4] Darrell Thorp then adds a compressor and a [[Parallel compression]] track (sometimes with another multiband compressor after the broadband compressor).[^3] Darrell uses this same kind of chain for other instruments too. A boost around 250Hz can also help [[Frequency masking|mask]] harshness (see [[How to use complementary frequencies]]).[^5]

Make sure your nonlinear processing also has oversampling. If not, it can contribute to more harshness.

Mike Senior mentions using a transient designer to address pokey digital recordings.[^6] [[Softening digital transients]] follows this same principle, along with tape emulate and dynamic EQ.

"Dark" tape emulators, like the [[Emulating the FATSO|FATSO]], can help de-harsh. They warm the sound a bit but don't remove too much energy, since they add harmonics.[^7] Try cranking up the bias on a [[Tape saturation]] plugin.

If you need to boost without it getting harsh, try one of the following. Dan Worrall says some engineers may like linear phase EQ boosts for the way the pre-ringing smoothes transients.[^8] Use upward compression on the high band. Emiliano Caballero does this in parallel.[^9]
