# Use bus compression for glue
The different parts will share a common fate because their amplitude changes are similar, which cues our perception to blend them together.[^1]

For multiband compression, hit it at 0.5dB on each band. This can help the "aliveness" of a mix.[^2]

Dig in deep with a bus compressor to hear the density, then remove it. After losing the density, you can go in at the track level and work on the crest factor.[^3]
