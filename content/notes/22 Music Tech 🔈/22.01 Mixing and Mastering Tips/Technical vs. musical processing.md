# Technical vs. musical processing
It can be helpful to separate these processes in your mind. For problem-solving, turn to the technical. For more subjective sweetening, use the musical. This is why some engineers just run audio through a compressor without doing anything, for the way the circuitry adds something.[^1]

I like using [[Pro-Q 3]] and [[SlickEQ GE]] respectively for these tasks.
