# Bass EQ guide
Billy Decker says he always high-passes at 70Hz.[^1]

Boost the fundamental.[^2] Andy Wallace uses a Neve 1073 EQ and boosts 35Hz all the way. This is ~16dB of gain on [[Lindell 80]].[^3]

If the fundamental is still too soft, maybe [[Add a sub bass with midi]].

Consider cutting the low-mids if it's too muddy or nasally.[^4]

Bring out the first harmonic around 300 to hear the bass on small speakers.[^5] Andy Wallace boosts somewhere around 200-300Hz with an SSL EQ.[^3]

Bruce Swedien boosts around 800 Hz on a bass to add definition. For Marc Daniel Nelson, this is often all he does.[^6] Sara Carter does this same, on an SSL EQ.[^7] This is that nasal, honky sound that can often help basses speak through small speakers. It also can bring out the finger noise.[^8] Warren Huart likes 750, 850, 1k, or 1.5k.[^9] Following this with some compression can situate the boost a little better if it starts getting to be too much.[^10]

Brighten it between 1.6k-2k.[^5]

Give your high-pass a little resonance to boost the fundamental. Do the same with your low-pass to boost the attack.[^11] I like to use [[Volcano 3]] for this.
