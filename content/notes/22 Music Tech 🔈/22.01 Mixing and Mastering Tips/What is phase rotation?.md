# What is phase rotation?
Changing the phase by 180 degrees is the same as flipping the polarity. Polarity is either flipped or not. Phase can be anywhere in between.[^1]

Phase rotation is helpful for getting two different sources in phase as well as making asymmetrical waveforms (see [[Asymmetric saturation curves]]) more symmetrical, which can reduce [[Crest factor]].[^2] Phase rotation can also increase crest factor, as discussed in [[Have no fear about high-pass filtering]].[^3]

Phase rotation changes the frequency amplitudes, but not the frequency content.[^4]
