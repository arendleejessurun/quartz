# Tips for faster mixes
- Get to know your DAW and plugins—read the manuals.[^1] Billy Decker read his manual in several sittings in the bathroom.[^2]
- [[Use mix templates]]. I got a lot of inspiration from [Marc Daniel Nelson's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTiFMLxWUD4). 
- Use shortcuts.
- [[Use presets]]: channel strip presets, plugin presets, FX send presets. 
- Use my [[Mixing checklist]].
- Don't get stuck on one sound for too long. Shoot from the hip.[^2]
- Use Melodyne's macros.
- Cut down on the amount of plugins to choose from.[^3]
- Set a timer: how good can I get this in X amount of time?[^4]
- Work on a deadline.
- [[Listen before mixing]].
	- Sing and/or dance along to the track. 
	- Envision a film to the song.
	- Pay attention to those boredom spots.
	- Approach a record with positivity.[^5]
- Get the balance right before EQ and compression. [[Use fader balance to reduce EQ labor later]].
- [[Focus on the most important instruments]], especially voice, remember the [[Cocktail party effect]], and don't sweat the small stuff. In sign-painting, they say, [[Can you read it at 65 miles an hour?]]
- Use buss processing/top-down mixing.[^6]
- Keep it simple: only use the processing you *need*. Don't do anything automatically because this can sometimes create more problems to have to fix later. [[Have an intention and a plan for each mixing move]].
- [[Use reference tracks and reference monitors]]. Switch up your listening system regularly, e.g. move to a different set of speakers or headphones.[^7] 
- [[Respect the work you've already done]].
- Stop doing too much. Just fix the problems. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.[^8]
- Don't make more work for yourself by tinkering before getting the client's notes.[^9]
- Give the client a guide for sending tracks and giving notes. [[What I need when receiving your files]] and [[Dos and don'ts for giving revision notes]].[^9]
- Don't sweat it if the client hasn't asked for it.
