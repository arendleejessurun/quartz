# Gain riding with ReaComp
Set the RMS window rather large and the pre-comp to about half the RMS size. Attack and release can be set to 0 because of this. Use a very low ratio, about 1.1:1 or 1.2:1. Set the threshold and knee to work within the [[Action range]], so it's always compressing a little bit and almost never hits the full ratio.[^1]

I'm feeling a little underwhelmed with gain riding plugins these days, but maybe I'll try this out.
