# Perceptual encoder distortion
MP3, AAC, etc. are perceptual encoders. Codec (encoder/decoder) distortion artifacts may include:

- Loss of clarity; some codecs have a sample rate of 22.05kHz, making the bandwidth only go up to 11kHz
- Loss of reverberation
- Gurgling, swooshing, tinny, or chattering sounds resulting from amplitude envelope modulation
- Nonharmonic high-frequency sounds, especially on high percussion
- Time smearing
- Loss of bass[^1]
