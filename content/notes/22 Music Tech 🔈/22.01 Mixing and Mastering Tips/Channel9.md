## Tips and tricks
Doesn't alias very easily. Incredibly CPU efficient. This is great for some coloration. Neve is mid-rangey, API is open (sounds nice on piano). 2x OS fixes any aliasing, should it occur.

Chris says Neve is bassy and warm. Neve has the most extended top end, API a bit less, and SSL even less. The result with the slight boost before cutoff is that the SSL has some of that large-format console, hit record sparkle.[^1]

The Teac and Mackie modes are designed to work well for soft-synths.[^1]

## CPU
0.1%

## Sine sweep test at -18, spectrograph readings at -130dB
Only starts to alias considerably at about 110%
