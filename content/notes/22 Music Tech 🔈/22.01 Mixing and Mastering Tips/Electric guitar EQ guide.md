# Electric guitar EQ guide
There aren't many steadfast EQ rules for electric guitar. Electric guitar often requires different EQ treatments for every mix and part.[^1]

## Lows
Neck pickup sounds may be too fundamental-heavy.[^1] Palm-muted guitars risk having too much low-end buildup.[^2]

Sometimes guitars have tonal resonances that need to be tamed, just like when [[Managing resonances on bass]].[^3] There may be other low-mid resonances, perhaps one particular note that jumps out too much.[^4]

## Mids
500 Hz is a trouble spot for electric guitars.[^2] It's a honky region.[^5] Maybe [[Scoop distorted guitars with a dynamic EQ]].

1kHz, [[The problem-child frequency]], can be overpowering in guitars.

4kHz is another pain point. Billy Decker boosts 3kHz instead.[^6]

## Highs
Use a low-pass filter to cut out amp hiss.[^1] If EQ brings out too much distortion sound, [[Use a de-esser to tame high end]].
