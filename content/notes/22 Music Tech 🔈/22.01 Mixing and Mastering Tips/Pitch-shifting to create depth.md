# Pitch-shifting to create depth
Chorus tends to make sources sound less focused. Using pitch-shifting can produce a similar effect.[^1] The short delay in both instances softens the transient. These both, to some degree, simulate double tracking (which also diffuses transients).

Subtle chorus on a reverb signal can make that reverb sound more natural, mimicking the way air currents may naturally fluctuate (think Doppler effect as an extreme example). This is particularly useful in sparse arrangements where the reverb is exposed. Rates below one second work best.[^2]
