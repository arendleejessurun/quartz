# Reverb can be used to create blend
Use this when something is sticking out or is not "glued" into the mix.[^1] This technique can also be used to make disparate sources sound like one. [[Send chopped samples into the same room reverb]].

Short, natural-sounding reverbs tend to sound best for this purpose.[^2]

Try to minimize any tonal changes. Check the phase and polarity of your reverb and use EQ as needed.[^3]

Stereo width on a blend reverb can be desirable for creating a sense of space, but it may have an adverse effect on mono sources, so always use your ears.[^4]

[[EQ your reverb sends]]. Dynamics processors, like transient designers and de-essing, are useful too, if the reverb is distracting.[^5] I also like to use sidechain compression to duck the reverb when the dry signal is sounding.
