# Use a multiband gate on toms to minimize cymbal bleed
You'll need two bands. Gate the upper frequencies with a super fast release time to allow just the attack to get through and nothing else. Gate the lower frequencies with a slower release to allow the body of the drum to resonate. Both bands need side chains filters covering the same range as well as thresholds at the same setting.[^1]
