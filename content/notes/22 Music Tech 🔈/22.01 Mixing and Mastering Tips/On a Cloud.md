## Mix checklist
- [X] Balance
- [X] Fix
	- [x] Route SPAN for references
	- [x] More automation, peel back layers for contrast
	- [x] A little more modern shine
		- [x] Use Satin
	- [x] Relaxing glue compression
	- [x] More energy shifts between sections
		- [x] Bass and treb shelves at chor
	- [x] 0:28-0:55 Pitchy intro vocal, anyway to make less pitchy?
	- [x] More violin in general
	- [x] More guitar in general
	- [x] A little more vocal in general
	- [x] 1:45 even bigger
	- [x] 1:56 crescendo even bigger
	- [x] 2:07 even bigger
	- [x] 2:08-2:13 climax
	- [x] 2:20-2:32 comes in stronger after cutting out, maybe brighten guitar to make the hit punchier?
	- [x] 2:43-onward more merlin 
	- [x] 3:16 pitchy vocal
	- [x] 3:24 remove “dream” vocal after you’re drifting into. (Or have hit on downbeat?)
	- [x] END of song: remove background vocal, breathing, and clutter at the end of song
	- [x] 2:59-3:06:, sounds like an oink, not enough like a bird tweet because of distortion; make more birdlike or remove if possible?
	- [x] For building section:
		- [x] Turn down bass/cello at beginning, allow it to slowly increase in volume
		- [x] Lilac light house more jakob vox
		- [x] More vox each new section
		- [x] Blue bird feather lose the cello/most other instruments other than bell/chimey thing, so can come in strong for the hit at 2:20

- [X] Shape
- [x] Space [[CoW RoomVerb]]
	- [X] Room verb
	- [x] Width
		- [x] Stereo image vox

## Notes on mix 2
Really nice overall!
- [x] Done ✅ 2022-06-29
	- [x] A little more merlin in intro. ✅ 2022-06-29
	- [x] 1:05-1:20 vocal a little pitchy, are you able to make a little less pitchy? ✅ 2022-06-29
	- [x] Twinkly bits are nice but curious to hear last harmony, “bluebird feather fly together,” with even less behind it ✅ 2022-06-29
	- [x] 2:57-3:11 dove sound? Turn way down/pan or cut ✅ 2022-06-29
		- Just concerned about other bird getting too loud
	- [x] Maybe you can pull the “dream” vocal from 0:53 at the end, doesn’t sound quite right just cutting out. ✅ 2022-06-29

### In this version
- Boosted merlin.
- Fixed pitchy 1:05-1:20 vocal.
- Dropped level of instruments at "bluebird feather fly together."
- Pulled down bird sounds at 2:57-3:11.
- Found a way to get rid of that "oinking bird" that got picked up by the nylon guitar mic at the 3 min mark, so we can get rid of added bird sounds entirely, if you like.
- Put "dream" back at the end.
- Added some quiet bird sounds at the bridge just to give those SFX later in the song some continuity.

## Mix 4
- [x] very slightly more merlin in intro. ✅ 2023-03-07
- [x] 1:06-1:11 tiniest bit more Evan vocal? ✅ 2023-03-07
- [x] Great job! ✅ 2023-03-07
