# Reverb can be used to create size
Natural-sounding reverbs are best for this purpose, just as taught in [[Reverb can be used to create blend]].[^1] This kind of emulates a room for the full ensemble. 

Longer pre-delays will not cause too much blend with the dry signal. Start with 50 ms. Use a tempo-matched delay to prevent distracting flams.[^2] Pre-delay can also make a space sound larger, even if it has a short decay time.[^3]
