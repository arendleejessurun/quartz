# Plugin design ideas
A MaxxVolume alternative, which does both upwards and downwards compression, with oversampling options. I can have it work in parallel and series. I think MaxxVolume is parallel. Maybe with a leveler/limiter too.

A saturator that allows you to dial in exactly which harmonics. Kind of like that Airwindows Pafnuty plugin.

A low-CPU saturator that does both preamp and tape distortion.
