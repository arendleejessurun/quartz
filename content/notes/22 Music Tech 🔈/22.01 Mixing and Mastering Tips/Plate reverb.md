# Plate reverb
Plates have instant onset and diffusion. This makes them useful for [[Drum reverb]] and as reverb for other high-transient sources.[^1]

Differences in pickup position on a physical plate create a Haas effect, which contributes to the stereo depth of plates, like it's coming from behind the speakers.[^1]

[[ValhallaPlate]] is my favorite plate reverb plugin.

Plates can give a Henry Mancini sound on orchestral instruments.[^2]
