# Split bass technique
I usually split the bass above the fundamental, around 120-150Hz.[^1] I do this by first [[Creating a multiband linear phase crossover]].

With this technique, I can [[Use the fundamental from the bass DI]].[^2]

On the low band, I have great control over [[Saturating low end]]. Michael Brauer compresses and adds saturation on the low end.[^3] I can also [[Use a limiter on the low-end]] or [[Expand low end for clarity]].

I can also saturate the high band to bring out the attack of the bass. Warren Huart uses parallel distortion.[^4] Try sending to a parallel saturation with a midrange boost, followed by a compressor to help the bass mids cut through.[^5]

I can also use [[Stereo processing]] on this high band too. 
Send it to stereo effects, like chorus or reverb.[^6] Dave Pensado uses a chorus, Jayden Joshua pans different frequencies across the stereo field.[^7]
