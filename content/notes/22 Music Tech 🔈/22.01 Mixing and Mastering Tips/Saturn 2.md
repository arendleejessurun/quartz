# Saturn 2

## Tips and tricks
The "subtle" settings are effective for bus processing.[^1]

The dynamics knob does expansion and compression.[^1]

The oversampling does 8x or 32x.[^1]

### Styles
- **Tube emulations**: "from subtle and clean, high mastering-grade tubes to juicy or even broken tube sound."[^2] Subtle tube sounds really nice for [[Mixing vocals]].
- **Tape emulations**: "subtle, clean, warm or extreme [[Tape saturation]]." Subtle tape doesn't need OS at or below 60%.
- **Amplifier emulations**: "from American and British classics to modern smooth, crunchy or screaming amplifiers."
- **Transformer emulations**: "from subtle and controlled to colorful and lush-sounding transformer emulations."[^2] The transformer settings have DC blocking, which acts as a high pass filter and is useful for cleaning up low end.[^1] Subtle transformer doesn't need OS. Gentle transformer doesn't need it up to 60%.
- **Smudge**: "this creative distortion algorithm smudges and stretches the audio in weird and unexpected ways. The Drive knob sets the amount of smudging/stretching."
- **Breakdown**: "a combination of down pitching and aggressive distortion. Great in combination with the Drive Pan knob!"
- **Foldback**: "an aggressive and very digital sounding form of clipping."
- **Rectify**: a crunchy combination of rectified sound, DC offset removal and soft clipping."
- **Destroy**: "a destructive combination of bit-crushing, sample rate reduction and clipping."
- "The **Tone controls** adjust the bass, mid, treble and presence of the processed band signal, allowing you to tweak the harmonics generated by the distortion algorithm."[^2]

## CPU
0.1-0.4% depending on OS

## Oversampling IR
More post-ring than [[Satin]]
![[saturn 2 impulse subtle tube.png]]

For some reason, warm tube and warm tape modes have much less post-ring

The amps generally look like this

### Transformer
Subtle transformer, 100% drive, "good" quality
For some reason this setting won't render in RX

Gentle transformer, 100% drive, "good" quality

Warm transformer, 50% drive, "superb" quality
![[saturn 2 sine sweep warm transformer 50% superb.png]]

### FX
Rectify, 0% drive, "superb" quality

## Hammerstein test

### Tube
Generally generates first four harmonics, with odd harmonics being higher amplitude

Subtle tube, 50%
![[saturn 2 hammerstein subtle tube.png]]

Clean tube, 50%
![[saturn 2 hammerstein clean tube.png]]

Warm tube, 50%
As the name implies, this one has more even harmonics
![[saturn 2 hammerstein warm tube.png]]

Broken tube, 50%
![[saturn 2 hammerstein broken tube.png]]

### Tape
Generally generates 3rd and 5th harmonics

Subtle tape, 50%
![[saturn 2 hammerstein subtle tapesaturn 2 hammerstein subtle tape.png]]

Clean tape, 50%
![[saturn 2 hammerstein subtle tapesaturn 2 hammerstein clean tape.png]]

Warm tape, 50%
![[saturn 2 hammerstein subtle tapesaturn 2 hammerstein warm tape.png]]

Old tape, 50%
![[saturn 2 hammerstein subtle tapesaturn 2 hammerstein old tape.png]]

### Saturation
This generates odd harmonics at a pretty consistent level, unlike tape, which is highly program dependent. Use this for more control in multiband mode.

Subtle saturation, 50%
![[saturn 2 hammerstein subtle tapesaturn 2 hammerstein subtle sat.png]]

Gentle saturation, 50%
![[saturn 2 hammerstein subtle tapesaturn 2 hammerstein gentle sat.png]]

Heavy saturation, 50%
![[saturn 2 hammerstein subtle tapesaturn 2 hammerstein heavy sat.png]]

### Transformer
Again, mostly odd harmonics.

Subtle transformer, 50%
![[saturn 2 hammerstein subtle tapesaturn 2 hammerstein subtle trans.png]]

Gentle transformer, 50%
![[saturn 2 hammerstein subtle tapesaturn 2 hammerstein gentle trans.png]]

Warm transformer, 50%
Slightly more even harmonics here
