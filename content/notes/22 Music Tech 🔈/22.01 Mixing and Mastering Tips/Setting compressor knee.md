# Setting compressor knee
A soft knee can result in more transparent compression. However, it also causes the compressor to start working below the threshold, so it can make extreme threshold, ratio, attack, and release settings more extreme.[^1]

Roey Izhaki recommends a knee range as wide as the [[Action range]] of the input signal.[^2]
