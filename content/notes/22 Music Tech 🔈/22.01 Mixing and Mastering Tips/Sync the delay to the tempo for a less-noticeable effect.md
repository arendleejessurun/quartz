# Sync the delay to the tempo for a less-noticeable effect
Tempo-synced delays are less noticeable because the transient of the next beat of the dry signal often masks the transient of the delayed signal.[^1]

Tempo-synced delays can push an element back into the soundstage. An out-of-sync delay can bring the element closer.[^2]

If you do opt for an out-of sync delay, delays slightly slower than the beat can give nice musical results.[^3]

If an out-of-sync delay is undermining the rhythm, try a polyrhythmic delay.[^4]

Several out-of-sync delays can create a cool reverb-like effect.[^5]
