# Shaping transients to create depth
Quiet transients and longer sustain can make a sound sit in the background.[^1] You can do this with compression or a transient designer. Dave Pensado demonstrates it here with a transient designer.[^2] Some instruments, like pads for example, naturally sit back in the mix for this reason.

[[Reverb can be used to create blend]], but if it causes too much blend, expansion, gating, and transient processing can reduce the low-level sustain in between transients.[^3]

Having a fast release on a compressor allows the transients to come through more. (On a tangential note, it also allows the compressor to react more often, creating a more leveled sound.) This helps the compressed source sit closer in the mix.[^4] The inverse is true too.

Phase changes from EQ can soften transients too.[^5] [[Pitch-shifting to create depth]] does a similar thing.
