# Phase cancel snares to reduce bleed
When working with a snare that has lots of bleed, duplicate the track and flip the polarity. On the polarity-inverting channel, compress with a fast attack and release and high ratio. Now the transients of the snare will be different than the original track and will no longer polarity-cancel.

Follow with a linear-phase high-pass to isolate cymbals. This will polarity-cancel the cymbals.

Put the two tracks into a folder to further process the isolated snare sound with EQ or reverb.[^1]

This can also be done with other drum shells.

I think I should rather do all this to the original track so the speaker is pushing rather than pulling when the snare hits. I can also just invert the polarity of the folder track to accomplish this.
