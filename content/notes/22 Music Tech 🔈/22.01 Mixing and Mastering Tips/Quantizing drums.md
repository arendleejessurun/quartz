# Quantizing drums
1. Render the shells and use them as the guide track.[^1]
2. Group items together with g.
3. Use [[Dynamic split]] on the guide track.[^2]
4. Turn off auto-crossfade and trim content behind from the options drop-down.[^1]
5. [[How to quantize with Reaper]] to taste.
6. Then follow this with [[Fill gaps between selected items]]. For drums, [[Use a leading pad to create a smoother quantization|Use a leading pad]] of 50ms.[^3]

These days, I'm using [[MK Slicer]].

Don't edit them too hard. Something I've learned from electronic producers, like Alice Yalcin Efe, is that having swing and having hits slightly off the grid creates groove.[^4]

Warren Huart does this manually. If something is out-of-time, he'll edit the hit by cutting it (just before the hit, so as to preserve some looseness) and press a key command to align it to the grid.[^5] I prefer to use slip editing for this.
