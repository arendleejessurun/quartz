# Testing speakers' comb-filtering
On a speaker with a tweeter and a woofer, a crossover splits the signal and sends it to two drivers: one to the tweeter, and one to the woofer. This crossover region often occurs in the mid range, which is unfortunately where our ears are most sensitive and where most instruments lie. In this crossover range, there is bound to be at least some spectral information that is being sent to both the tweeter and the woofer, and if these frequencies hit the listening position at the same time, there will be resulting comb-filtering.^[ [[Mixing Secrets for the Small Studio]] pg. 15]

Use the PinkNoise file here^[ [Chapter 1: Nearfield Monitors](https://cambridge-mt.com/ms/ch1/)] to test the comb-filtering between the drivers of a speaker. Play it through a single nearfield monitor from two feet away, then move six inches up and down to hear the tonal change that comes from comb-filtering.^[ [[Mixing Secrets for the Small Studio]] pg. 15]

This can help figure where best to position your speakers.
