# Crossfading items
When auto-crossfade is enabled, just drag one item on top of another. Hold shift and drag to move the crossfade region. Just like with [[Changing fade curves]], right-click to change the curve shape.^[ [Fades & Crossfades in REAPER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLFMV7ae3TE)]

You can also turn off auto-crossfading from the toolbar.
