# Reaper MIDI editor
Create a MIDI item by either recording or cmd+click-dragging a section of the track length.[^1]

MIDI editor preferences can be accessed under Preferences.[^2]

Change scrolling and zooming behavior in the Actions list and selected MIDI editor from the dropdown on the right.[^3]

Right-click the grey area above the piano roll and mouse over to Options to change more about the MIDI editor.[^4]

Other cool actions [here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/P0b1QDW7pjo).

Press J to join notes.[^5]

Use the MIDI randomization script for fun.[^5]

You can edit velocities globally by right-clicking and going to event properties. By using division or multiplication functions, you can compress or expand the velocities. Combine this with the filter to edit specific notes.[^6] You can do a similar thing with the JS MIDI Scaler/Compressor plugin.[^7]

Humanize velocities with H.[^8]

## Drums
Right-click the grey area above the piano roll and mouse over to View to choose 'Named notes' for editing drums (I have this set to a toolbar button). Double-click a key to change note names. Hold command and drag to move notes around (doing so doesn't interfere with the mapping).[^8] Under the View submenu, you can also hide unused and unnamed note rows.[^9] 

Right-click the grey area above the piano roll and mouse over to File to save note names to a file.[^9]

Kenny Gioia shows how to create a 'Drum mode' toolbar button.[^10] Alejandro has a similar setup.[^8]

Using MIDI grooves can help workflow.[^11]

Use the Explode MIDI note rows action to create stems for the drums.[^7]
