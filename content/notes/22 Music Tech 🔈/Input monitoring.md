# Input monitoring
Right-click arm track button to change input monitoring modes, or click speaker to cycle through monitoring modes. Learn more about the monitoring modes [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeuP7q4ls3Y).

Kenny Gioia has a clever workaround for direct monitoring with reverb [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Y2xFmGkakw&t=206s). However, my CPU is probably fast enough to allow for monitoring with FX. At the tracking level, it will be important to use CPU-efficient plugins.
