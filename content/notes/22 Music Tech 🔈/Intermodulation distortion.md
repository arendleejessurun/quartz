# Intermodulation distortion
If you distort two sine waves at once, not only does each sine get its own harmonic series, but each sine affects the way the other is distorted, which results in sum and difference partials. E.g. if you've got 100Hz and 200Hz, you get a sum partial of 300Hz and a difference partial of 100Hz.[^1]

This is the basis of rock and roll, forming the power chord. But too much can make things sound wrong.[^1]
