# MK Slicer
Open with shift+q.

Press the Q button to slice, quantize, and fill gaps. Press the Slice button to revert quantization.

Select all multi-mic tracks, like drums, to quantize at once, without needing to group first.[^1]

Use it to trigger samples.[^2]

Controls:
- Mousewheel or left/right keys - horizontal zoom
- Middle drag - scroll
- Shift+left drag - move marker  
- Right-click marker - delete marker
- Right-click empty space - create marker
- Ctrl+left drag - change velocity[^2]

Recommended settings:
- For percussion and plucked string instruments, low cut up to 2.5kHz.
- For multitrack live drums (kick and snare guide track), low cut 200Hz and high cut 4.5kHz.[^2]
