# Parallel processing with MRatio
1. Start with "dry" track
2. Create aux track for parallel processing
3. Create summing track
4. Send dry track to summing track channels 1/2
5. Send aux track to summing track channels 3/4 (sidechain)
6. Add MRatio to summing track
7. Change crossfade mode to linear
8. Blend in ratio to taste
