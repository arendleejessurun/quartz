# Use a leading pad to create a smoother quantization
When using [[Fill gaps between selected items]], use a leading pad of 50ms. This helps make sure things like flams or looser performances get quantized well. I use this setting to [[Quantizing drums]].

Usually there's more silence before a hit than there is after. If you drag your trailing pad too far, you may hear the same hit twice if the player is rushing.^[ [How I EDIT A Full Band Session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV25fXFzBp0)] If they're dragging, then it's the opposite problem.

For bass, guitar, and other such instruments, I like to use a leading pad of 5-20ms to create a backward temporal mask (see [[How to mask time edits]]).
