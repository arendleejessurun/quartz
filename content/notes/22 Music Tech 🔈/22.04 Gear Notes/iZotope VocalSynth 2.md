# iZotope VocalSynth 2

## Tips and tricks
Use the gate in the middle panel to cut out unwanted sounds.[^1]

There's a built-in pitch correction.[^1]

In the top panel, you can open up the advanced settings (the button with the three sliders) to change vowel formant, pitch-shifting, etc.[^1]

In auto mode, you can input the key in the pitch tab, and in the voicing tab, you can select harmonies.[^2]

Sidechain mode allows you to vocode other signals.[^1]

In MIDI mode, you can select mono as well as poly. Mono has some cool glide to it.[^2]
