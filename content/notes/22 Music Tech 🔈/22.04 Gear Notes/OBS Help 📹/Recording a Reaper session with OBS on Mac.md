# Recording a Reaper session with OBS on Mac
Use Loopback to capture Reaper audio.[^1] In OBS create a Display Capture.[^2] Create an Audio Input Capture and set device to Loopback Audio.

Another way is to use [BlackHole](https://existential.audio/blackhole/), create a Multi-Output Device with Audio MIDI Setup. In Reaper, change the Audio Device to this new Multi-Output Device. In OBS audio settings, select BlackHole as Mic/Auxiliary Audio. You can also use this method to separate audio tracks for editing later.[^7]

You can also record video with OBS and audio with Reaper.[^4]

I'd like to learn how to do the same with Focusrite loopback, that way I can minimize the amount of apps I have to use.[^5] Loopback inputs are 5 and 6.[^6]
