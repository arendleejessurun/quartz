# GGD Dry and Funky
Inspired by The Fearless Flyers drum sound.[^1]

In the mixer window, Trash is a trashy room mic.[^1]

You can change the midi note mapping in the settings.[^1] GM will be compatible with most other midi drum software.

You can tune different drums by using multiple instances of the Kontakt library, using the mixer to isolate the drum you want to tune, then using Kontakt's native Tune knob.[^2] I think I'd prefer to do this in post with a plugin.

Use [[Multi-routing MIDI with Kontakt and Reaper]] to separate the drums into their own channels. Alternatively, explode the note rows into their own tracks (see [[Reaper MIDI editor]]).
