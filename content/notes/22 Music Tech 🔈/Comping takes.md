# Comping takes
To comp different takes, use [[Split items]].

Select all items and right-click Comps > Save as new comp. You can save multiple comps too.

You can right-click Comps > Move active comps to top lane.

Show all takes in lanes when there's room with cmd+l.

Consolidate comp with crop to active take (opt+shift+t).

There are lots of actions for comps too.

Right-click Take > Lock to active take to avoid accidentally switching takes.[^1]

Use action "Explode takes of items across tracks" to separate takes into their own tracks.[^2]
