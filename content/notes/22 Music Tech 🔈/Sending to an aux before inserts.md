# Sending to an aux before inserts
In the routing window, you can choose pre-FX.[^1]

With [[JS Channel Router]], I can route my input channels 1+2 to a different sidechain and then send those channels to my aux.

An example setup:
- Perform some light vocal compression.
- Have Channel Router output 1+2 to 3+4.
- Send channels 3+4 to a reverb aux. This allows for a more dynamic "performance" of the vocal reverb and lets me do tricks like [[Expansion on reverb]] a little better.
- On the dry track, continue with more leveling as desired. This way, any other dynamic processing is happening after the send.

I can then move Channel Router to different places in the chain if I want certain other processes to come before or after the send.
