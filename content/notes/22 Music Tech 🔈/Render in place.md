# Render in place
I've set a custom action to cmd+opt+shift+r. I've made my custom action a little bit different from the one in the video, swapping out the last two actions for:
- Set all FX offline for selected tracks
- Set all take FX offline for selected items
- Set all selected media temporarily offline

I follow this up with removing the track control panel (TCP) and mixer control panel (MCP) from the interface using [[Track manager]].
