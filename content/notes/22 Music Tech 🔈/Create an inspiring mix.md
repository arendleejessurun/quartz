# Create an inspiring mix
An inspiring mix is not necessarily technically impressive (e.g. clear, punchy), but it's keyed in to the emotion of the song. Matthew Weiss says he has seen clients choose "emotional" mixes over "technically right" mixes. Before mixing, set emotional descriptions of what the listener should feel.[^1]
