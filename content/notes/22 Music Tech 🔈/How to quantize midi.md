# How to quantize midi
Double-click midi item to open midi editor. Press q to open quantize menu. Use manual setting to see more options. You can bypass any quantization edits.[^1]

Using a lower strength percentage can make the performance quantized, yet human-sounding.[^2] You can also use the "Only quantize range" to achieve this.

Click OK when you're done editing in order to keep working with it. Click Commit to commit to the final performance.

Right click the bar above the midi roll for more options like un-quantize, freeze quantize, and humanize.[^1]
