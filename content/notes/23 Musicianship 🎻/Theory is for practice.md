# Theory is for practice
![[I hear and I forget]]

Theory is good, but its main purpose is to give structure to the practice. This is the same principal behind [[Doctrine may become an obstacle to mysticism]]. Theory is only good if it serves the goals of the practitioner.

![[One learns â€¦ primarily through writing]]

Theory that does not serve the practitioner needs to be developed. Theory is for practice. That practice can then feedback to more developed theory. [[Good theory is experience plus reflection]], and [[Music theory is just collected wisdom]].

With this in mind, individuals can create their own music theory, like a [[Folksonomy]].
