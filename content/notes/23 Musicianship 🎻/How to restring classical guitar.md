# How to restring classical guitar
[This article](https://www.guitarbitz.com/pages/how-to-restring-a-classical-guitar?utm_source=pocket_mylist) helped me get started.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9nERN2_Fe0) shows tying around the capstans best, as well as a technique for the 1st string at the bridge.

It took me an hour last time because I was having to remember how to do all this.
