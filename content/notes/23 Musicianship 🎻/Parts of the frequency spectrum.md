- Bass fundamental usually around 85Hz

Low-mids: 120-500Hz
- Body, punch, and impact
- Fundamentals of most instruments

Mid-range: 500-2kHz
- Can get crowded
- Usually where you need to notch out specific frequency buildups

High-mids: 2kHz-7.5kHz
- Brightness and attack
- This is where to boost if you want the track to cut through

Highs: 7.5kHz
