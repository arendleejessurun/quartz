# Formants
Formants are the resonances of a space, for instance, the human vocal tract.[^1]

In speech, they exist below 5000Hz and are usually in-harmonic.[^2]

The first formant frequency is higher for open vowels, like [a], and lower for closed vowels, like [i] or [u]. The second formant frequency is higher for front vowels, like [i], and lower for back vowels, like [u].[^1]

I wonder if this first and second formant frequency is responsible for complementary frequencies (see [[How to use complementary frequencies]]).

F1 corresponds to vowel height, and F2 corresponds to vowel advancement (back or forward).[^3]

More about this in chapter five of [[Cantabile]].
