# Collect sounds
Collect voice memos, riffs, melodies, found sounds, samples, loops, beats—anything you'd like to hear again.[^1] Starting with a sample can get the juices flowing.[^2] Tracklib is a good resource for samples. Just be careful with using plain samples—copyright algorithms may block your song.
