# Collect words
Using the [[Lynda Barry journal method]], I can collect words that I heard or read, even [[Scan a book for interesting words]]. Austin Kleon calls this kind of thing a swipe file.[^1] The artist's job is collect good ideas.[^2] This is why I love Obsidian: it lets me write and organize and connect ideas.
