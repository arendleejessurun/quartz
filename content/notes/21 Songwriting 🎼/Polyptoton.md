# Polyptoton
This is the repeated use of one word as in different parts of speech or grammatical structures.[^1] It's a figure of emphasis. It's also called paregmenon.[^2] Greek for "having many cases."[^3]

Examples include:
- The Beatles' "Please Please Me"
- "Love is not love / Which alters when it alteration finds, / Or bends with the remover to remove." —Shakespeare 
- "Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us."
- "But me no buts." —Susanna Centlivre
- "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind." —Neil Armstrong (also a good example of [[Antithesis]])
