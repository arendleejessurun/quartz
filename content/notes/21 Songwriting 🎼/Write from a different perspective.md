# Write from a different perspective
Write from the point-of-view of another character, like an animal. Jeff Tweedy says he has written some very personal songs this way. The cover of being someone or something else may allow you to be honest. You can write as or for another artist too. Jeff Tweedy has written in the voice of Johnny Cash and Mavis Staples.[^1] Imagine the way that they look at the world, and write from there.[^2] [[Imitation is an exercise in finding one's voice]].
