# What is the daily work of songwriting?
[[Collect words]]. Collect interesting words and phrases. Free-write. Write poetry.[^1]

[[Collect sounds]]. Stockpile music in [[Tunes]]. Make demos. Practice. Learn other people's songs. Write parts for songs in-progress.[^1]

Pair words and music.[^1] I tags words and melody by poetic meter, e.g. iambic quadrameter, kind of like hymn-writers do.

Just doing one of these things a day is enough.[^1]
