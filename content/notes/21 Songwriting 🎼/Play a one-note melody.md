# Play a one-note melody
Plunk out a one-note melody on a piano or another instrument. Songs like "Know" by Nick Drake or "Rang Tang Ring Toon" by Mountain Man can have just a one-note accompaniment.^[ [[How to Write One Song]] ch. 15] Or it can be the start of a larger arrangement.

Doing this on an unfamiliar instrument is bonus points.
