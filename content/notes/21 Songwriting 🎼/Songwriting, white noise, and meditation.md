# Songwriting, white noise, and meditation
There is song. No one is singing. This is a verse inspired by the gathas in [[Sitting with the Buddha]]. I may like to pray this next time I'm struggling to write a song. It reminds me of that "disappearing" that Jeff Tweedy talks about in [[How to Write One Song]]. 

Jeff also says, "The ability to write a song is the ability to hear it."[^1]

The white noise throughout the universe already has in it every frequency. My job is to just listen for the threads of frequencies that I like and imitate those. 

This makes me think of the spiritual "Over my head, I hear music in the air," and the music of the spheres.
