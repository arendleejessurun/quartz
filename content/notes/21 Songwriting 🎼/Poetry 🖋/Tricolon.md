# Tricolon
Three parallel words or phrases. From Greek "three unit."[^1]

When combined with alliteration or rhyme, it can produce a surprising effect when the third breaks form, as in, "Wine, women, and song," and "Ready, steady, go."[^2]

It's also effective if the last item is longer, as in, "Friends, Romans, countrymen," and "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers."[^3]
