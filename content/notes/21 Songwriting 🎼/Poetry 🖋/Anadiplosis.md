# Anadiplosis
It's a type of repetition. From Greek "to double."[^5]

Examples include:
- "Tribulation worketh patience, and patience, experience, and experience, hope, and hope maketh man not ashamed." —St. Paul[^1]
- "Suffering breeds character; character breeds faith; in the end faith will not disappoint." —Jesse Jackson[^2]
- "For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime." —Milton[^4]

Mark Forsyth says, "Anadiplosis gives the illusion of logic."[^3]
