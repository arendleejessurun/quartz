# Learn the tradition
Keeping up with what's hip doesn't make for developing a contemporary voice. Become steeped in the past, and then you will find your own contemporary voice. Just because it's old doesn't mean it's old hat. Don't worry about keeping up with what's new. There's too much new stuff to keep up with anyway. Most of what calls itself contemporary is made from a desire to be liked, an imitation of what's already around it.[^1] Following trends is a losing battle. Developing a fresh voice is like being on the vanguard. [[Why create?]] To find one's voice.

To learn the tradition, go back into your [[My creative family tree|Creative family tree]] and find their influences. 

If one had to make the choice between reading and attending a workshop, read.[^2]
