# Poetry uses the sound of words
[[A Poetry Handbook]]

page:: 19-28

Poetry uses the sound of words. (Music uses the sound of vibrations. The two together create song.)

![[When you write pretty much anything, you're essentially asking someone to read a musical score]]

There's something appealing about the sound of words, beyond their dictionary meaning. "Most of the time, when listening to music in a foreign language, we enjoy the lyrics as sounds and not words," says Thea Tolentino, music teacher and music therapy master's student.[^1]

Each word has its own sound and therefore unique meaning. For instance, a "rock" is not the same as a "stone." This makes me think of that book [[Landmarks]]. [[Ding-dong theory]] took a stab at explaining this.

After learning consciously these techniques, the unconscious mind can employ them in near-miraculous conjunctions of sound and sense. I know the same to be true about vocal technique—practice the technique consciously until it becomes second nature, so in performance, you don't have to think so hard.
