# Plain language is more intimate
Over-use of big words and flowery language creates no contrast in a poem. Moreover, most people don't speak that way. [[Art is conversation]]. No one likes the arrogant-artsy type. What I love about folk art and so-called "outsider art" is the way in which it levels the playing field and offers an equitable entry into creativity, such that no one is an outsider.

I don't know what it is, but I find some modern poetry really grating. It's not so much the poetry actually, but the way people talk about it.
