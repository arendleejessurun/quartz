# The sounds of the alphabet
Vowels can be perfectly sounded without a consonant. A consonant can’t be perfectly sounded until joined to a vowel. 

Vowels:
a, e, i, o, u, sometimes w and y

Consonants are divided into semivowels and mutes. 

Semivowels can be imperfectly sounded without a vowel and can extend the sound of a syllable. I’ve added myself the distinction between voiced and unvoiced, which I learned in music school.

Voiced semivowels: 
j l m n r v w y z soft g

Unvoiced semivowels:
f h s x soft c

Liquids:
l m n r

Mutes can’t be sounded at all without a vowel and suddenly stop a syllable. Again, I’ve added the distinction of voiced and unvoiced. 

Voiced mutes:
b d hard g

Unvoiced mutes:
k p q t hard c
