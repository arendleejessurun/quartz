# Epistrophe
Epistrophe is repetition at the end of a clause or even paragraph. Verse-chorus structures can be thought of as elaborate epistrophes.[^1] Also known as epiphora and antistrophe. Kind of the opposite of [[Anaphora]].[^2] From Greek "turning about"[^3] or "returning."[^4]

Examples include:
- "A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!" —Shakespeare[^5]
- "Wherever they's a fight so hungry people can eat, _I'll be there_. Wherever they's a cop beatin' up a guy, _I'll be there_. ... An' when our folk eat the stuff they raise an' live in the houses they build—why, _I'll be there_." —John Steinbeck, *The Grapes of Wrath*[^2]
