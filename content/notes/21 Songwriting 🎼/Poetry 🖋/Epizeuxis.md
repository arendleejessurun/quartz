# Epizeuxis
Repeating the same word with the same sense.[^1] It can be used for emphasis or humor[^2] or even drudgery.[^3] Works best in threes, but in rare cases twos are effective too.[^4] Also called cuckowspell, doublet, geminatio, underlay, and palilogia.[^5] From Greek "to fasten together."[^7]

Examples include:
- "O horror, horror, horror!" —Shakespeare, *Macbeth*[^6]
- "The horror! The horror!" —Conrad, *Heart of Darkness*[^4]
- "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"[^4]
