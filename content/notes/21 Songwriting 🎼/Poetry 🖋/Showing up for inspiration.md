# Showing up for inspiration
Making appointments to write is like making dates between the heart and the skills of the conscious mind. The heart of writing, inspiration, is often shy if it senses there is little commitment. But keep appointments, and soon it begins to show up when you do.[^1]

![[Inspiration has to be invited â€”Jeff Tweedy]]

Most people who have a fulfilling life in art work at it everyday, inviting inspiration.[^2] Learn for yourself [[How to make creativity a habit]].

Austin Kleon learned from Lynda Barry that if you don't know what to write in your diary, write the date as slowly and neatly as you can, and ideas will start to come up. If you start going through the motions, the motion will kickstart your brain into idea mode.[^3]
