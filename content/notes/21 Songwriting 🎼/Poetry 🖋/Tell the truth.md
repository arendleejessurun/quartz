# Tell the truth
Tell the story conversationally and honestly.[^1] Do this, and talking about yourself will not be an act of egotism.[^2]

If the story is not about you, you can use your own personal experiences to practice vulnerability.[^3]

Mary Gauthier at the [[Saved by a Song Seminar]] said, "Tell the truth. Don't worry who you will scare."
