# Free write to stoke creativity
Julia Cameron calls these [[Morning pages]].

Write down whatever is on your mind, from nagging to-dos to creative ideas in a brain dump. Brain dumps can also be helpful for processing emotions and recovering from [[Break in case of burnout|Burnout]].[^1]

Gabriel Kahane did this one month, writing until he had something or until his hand cramped.[^3]

Expressive writing is often prescribed for mental health.[^2]
