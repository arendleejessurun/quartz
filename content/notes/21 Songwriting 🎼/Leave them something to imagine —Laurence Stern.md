"The truest respect which you can pay to the reader's understanding, is to halve this matter amicably, and leave \[them] something to imagine, in his turn, as well as yourself. For my own part, I am eternally paying \[them] compliments of this kind, and do all that lies in my power to keep \[their] imagination as busy as a my own." —Laurence Sterne in *Tristam Shandy*, via [[The Reading Process—A Phenomenological Approach]]
