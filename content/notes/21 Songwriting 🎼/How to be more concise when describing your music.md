# How to be more concise when describing your music
Make it 6 words or less.[^1] Include 2-3 genres.[^2]

Put it in context of genres/styles/concepts that people are already familiar with, e.g. Cajun slamgrass.[^1]

Use artists you sound like. Let their marketing work for you.[^1]

Rule people out. Don't try to cater to everyone.[^1]
