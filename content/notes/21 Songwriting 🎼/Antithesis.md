# Antithesis
Juxtaposing contrasting ideas.[^5] Mark Forsyth says of it, "First you mention one thing: then you mention another,"[^1] and breaks it down as, "X is Y, and not X is not Y."[^2]

Examples include:
- "The well-bred contradict other people. The wise contradict themselves." —Oscar Wilde[^1]
- "Marriage has many pains, but celibacy has no pleasures." —Samuel Johnson[^4]

Wildean antithesis is mentioning one thing that everyone knows, then in the second statement starting off as expected but throwing a twist.[^1]

A long list of antitheses is called a progressio.[^3]
