# Have a conversation
Each of us is a natural improviser of words. Have a conversation with someone whom you find easy to talk to. Take that conversation, at least your side of it, and put it into lyrics. If you can speak honestly to someone you love, you can write an honest song.

This can be helpful for writer's block if I can't put my feelings into words: I can verbally process with someone.[^1] Sharing is collaborative in nature. I may be the one speaking, but the listener is making sense of what I'm saying. Having a sounding wall can be helpful for finding the words that I mean. [[Art is conversation]].
