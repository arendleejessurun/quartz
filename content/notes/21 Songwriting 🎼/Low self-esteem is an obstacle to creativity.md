# Low self-esteem is an obstacle to creativity
Most dreams are not realized because of not giving oneself permission rather than deficit in talent.^[ [[How to Write One Song]] ch. 3] Practice [[Writing just to write]] and [[Be willing to write a bad song]].

If we compare our gifts with others', we'll always find someone to envy. You can't quit because there's someone out there who knows more or can do more than you. An artistic gift is about communication and the ability to be oneself, not just the ability to execute a piece of music perfectly. Showing up with a willing heart is what resonates and transcends perfection.^[ [[How to Write One Song]] ch. 3]
