# Write the song you want to hear
![[I wanted to hear music that had not yet happened]]

Instead of writing what you know, Austin Klein suggests, write what you like.^[ [[Steal Like an Artist]] pg. 47]

![[If you write what you yourself sincerely think]]

What kind of art do I desire from my creative heroes? Can I bring that into being? Or is there any art that's missing? I think immediately about sad folk coming out songs. 

If I could assemble a supergroup of musicians like in *Bill and Ted: Face the Music*, or a think-tank of co-songwriters, who would be in that group?
