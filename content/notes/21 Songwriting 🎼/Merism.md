# Merism
Can be confused for [[Antithesis]].[^1] It's about naming a subject's parts in contrasting phrases to represent the totality. It can be considered a type of [[Synecdoche]]. From Greek "divided."[^2]

Examples include:
- "For better for worse, for richer for poorer, etc." is a merism for "in any circumstances."[^3]
- "Night and day you are the one." â€”Cole Porter[^4]
