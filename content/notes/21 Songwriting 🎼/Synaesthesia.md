# Synaesthesia
One sense described in terms of another. There are some norms. Sight and sound are interchangeable.[^1] Touch can be used to describe sound and sight, e.g. "warm."[^2]

Synaesthesias of smell are uncommon and even jarring, and can lead to a memorable line.[^2]

Synaesthesia is particularly effective when a sense is applied to something abstract, like victory.[^2]
