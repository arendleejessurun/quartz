# 21.04 Principles for Songwriting üßê
Treat the song as if it already exists, as I've realized in [[Songwriting, white noise, and meditation]].

[[Consider everything an experiment]]. [[Be willing to write a bad song]].

Work. The people who work come up with good ideas, as taught in rule 7 of [[Corita Kent's ten rules for teachers and students]].

[[Write the song you want to hear]].

[[Show, don't tell]].

Honor your metaphor.

[[Avoid adjectives]].

[[Don't overcook it]].

Let the verses tell the story and consider keeping the chorus lyrics the same each time. 

It often sounds best to keep the same rhyme scheme in a section and its recapitulations. 

Create variety by using different rhyme sounds in different sections. 

Use slant rhymes to avoid forcing a "perfect" rhyme. [[Go for clear over clever]]. 

Keep it simple. A multisyllabic word isn't going to make your song better.[^1] Again, go for clear over clever.

Assonant vowels in a slant rhyme makes the rhyme stronger, like "home" and "stone," as opposed to "pain" and "again."

Avoid words with few rhymes that lead to clich√©s, like "love" and "above."
