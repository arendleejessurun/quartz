# Creativity is like a healthy psychosis
U.K. Mann says boredom is "a search for neural stimulation that isn’t satisfied. If we can’t find that, our mind will create it."[^1]

A similar thing happens with meditation-induced psychosis. If I strip myself of sensory information, my brain starts making things up and hallucinating.[^2]

I wonder if creativity can actually prevent psychosis.
