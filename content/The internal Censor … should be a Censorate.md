"To keep his errors down to a minimum, the internal Censor to whom a poet submits his work in progress should be a Censorate. It should include, for instance, a sensitive only child, a practical housewife, a logician, a monk, an irreverent buffoon and even, perhaps, hated by all the others and returning their dislike, a brutal, foul-mouthed drill sergeant who considers all poetry rubbish." - W. H. Auden, [Auden on Writing, Originality, Self-Criticism, and How to Be a Good Reader](https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/08/10/auden-dyers-hand-reading-writing/?utm_source=pocket_mylist)
