# Don't worry about having a style
Your voice is not something you can control—it just comes out of you.[^1] So don't think or try too hard about having a style.[^2] I remember the first time this anxiety crept up on me. I was a 13-year-old guitarist realizing I liked too many different genres to be willing to just camp out on one, and yet, the thought of synthesizing such disparate genres seemed incredibly daunting and even disingenuous (though 13-year-old-me didn't use words like "daunting" and "disingenuous"—more like "poser" or "cheesy").
