# Use your better judgment
Instead of using your judgment to put yourself or others down, use your better judgment to discover what you like. Be clear with yourself about what you like, and don't be afraid of being judgmental.[^1] [[Judgment is a poor tool in the hands of insecurity]], but it judgment can be integrated well when ascribing goodness to something.
