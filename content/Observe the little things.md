# Observe the little things
In a meditative state, things that usually mean nothing to me can mean everything.[^1]

Rilke shares the things from which his eyes draw refreshment: the simple, inconsiderable things in nature, which hardly anyone sees.[^2] Part of the job of an artist is to call attention to overlooked things.[^3] Rilke commends, if you can cling to these, then everything will become "easier, more coherent and somehow more conciliatory … in your inmost consciousness."[^2] It sounds like he's describing [[Looking deeply|Vipassana]] and [[Integration]]. [[Yūgen]].
